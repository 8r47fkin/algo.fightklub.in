		<h1>THE BASIC LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            I had been in Wall Street 20 years when I discovered that it was possible to 
            judge the future course of the market by its own action. In my book, "Wall Street 
            Ventures and Adventures Through Forty Years" (pg. 168) I stated my experience 
            and observations in 1909 as follows: 
        </p>
        <p>
            "I saw more and more that the action of .stocks reflected the plans and 
            purposes of those who dominated them. I began to see possibilities of judging from 
            the very tape what these master minds were doing. My editorial work was proving 
            a most valuable means of self-education. In gathering material that would benefit 
            my readers, I was actively searching out the stuff that would aid me personally. 
            While my subscribers were given the best of what I collected, there was much in 
            material discarded which helped to build up what I might call a code of enlightened 
            procedure for use in this greatest of all the world's games.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I had a friend who had been a member of the Exchange and who was well 
            up on the technique of the market from the standpoint of the floor trader. We 
            often discussed the difference between reading the tape simply to follow price 
            changes (as most clients did) and reading the tape in order to judge the probable 
            action of stocks in the immediate future.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Starting from the simple ground that the logical, action of a stock was to 
            decline when offerings exceeded the number of shares bid for and to advance when 
            the amount bid for was greater than the amount offered, we agreed that the 
            quantity or volume of stock changing hands in each succeeding transaction was of 
            great importance. Anyone who undertook to read the minds of the momentary buyers 
            and sellers was able to measure, to a certain degree, their eagerness or anxiety 
            to buy or sell; also to measure the force of the buying power or selling power as 
            shown by the number of shares; and to judge of the purpose behind the action, 
            whether it was to buy without advancing the price, or to force the price up, or to 
            mark it down, or to discourage buying or selling by others, as the case might be.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Each transaction carried with it certain evidence, although it was not 
            always possible to interpret that evidence. All stocks no matter by whom they 
            were owned, bought or sold, looked alike on the tape. But the purposes behind this 
            buying and this selling were different and these might be fairly clear to those who 
            understood market psychology. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Each transaction, although recorded only once, represented a meeting of 
            minds; those of a buyer and a seller. This meeting of minds took place at a certain 
            post on the floor of the Stock Exchange, even though the buyer might be in the far 
            west and the seller in Europe. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Not all transactions were significant, but the interpreter must detect those 
            which were. He must see that some indicated a purpose. Some one or some group 
            was carrying, or attempting to carry, something through. He must take advantage 
            of that."
        </p>
        <p>
            Continuing my studies of the tape, I realized, that the Basic Law of Supply 
            and Demand governed all price changes; that the best indicator of the future 
            course of the market was the relation of supply to demand. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Law of Supply and Demand operates in all markets in every part of the 
            world. When demand exceeds supply, prices rise, and when supply is greater than 
            demand, prices decline. This is true not only of stocks; it is constantly being 
            demonstrated in markets for wheat, com, cotton, sugar and every other commodity 
            that is bought and sold; also in other markets such as real estate, labor, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I demonstrated this further in a series of articles entitled: "Studies in Tape 
            Reading" which attracted wide attention as the first of their kind ever published 
            anywhere, so far as I knew. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My basic idea in this series was that the stock market, by its own action,
            continually indicates the probable direction of its immediate and future trend, and 
            anyone able to determine this with accuracy should attain success in trading and 
            investing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Coming events, I claimed, were foreshadowed on the tape because large 
            interests there disclosed their anticipation of advances or declines by their 
            purchases or sales. So, too, with the manipulator who was endeavoring to raise or 
            depress prices. If one were to become sufficiently expert, he could judge by the 
            action of stocks what was in the minds of these large interests and follow them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The trend was simply the line of least resistance. When a stock met opposition in 
            its rise, it must either be strong enough to overcome this resistance 
            (selling) or it must inevitably turn downward, and when, in its downward course, 
            sufficient buying was encountered to halt the decline, it would turn upward. The 
            critical moments in all these various phases of the market were these minor and 
            major turning points, or else the points where the price broke through the 
            opposition into a new field. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Further development of this method of judging the market from its own 
            action resulted in my using it as a basis for predicting the probable course-of-the 
            market, and this eventually led to my issuing weekly, "The Trend Letter" (first 
            published in 1911) which had a most successful career for many years. In fact, 
            the forecasts contained in this Letter were so accurate that a large following was 
            developed. As a result of a series of successful campaigns we were not only 
            overwhelmed with business but brokerage houses throughout the country passed 
            along these advices to their clients. So many followers were thus gained that an 
            undue effect was had on the quotations for the stocks in which we traded, and in 
            certain cases the effect on the market was important. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the above in much more detail, is described in my book "Wall Street 
            Ventures and Adventures Through Forty Years" which it is advisable for you to 
            read. My reason for mentioning these facts is to show that this method of judging 
            the market by its own action was highly successful, from the standpoint of profits 
            realized for subscribers who followed my advices, as well as for many thousands 
            of people who were not subscribers but who bought and sold when we did. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From the above you may judge how vital it is, in the stock market, as in 
            every other field, to get down to the right principles.
