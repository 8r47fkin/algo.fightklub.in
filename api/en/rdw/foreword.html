		<h1>Foreword</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            This is a method of judging the stock market by its own action. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is intended for investors as well as for traders.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been planned and prepared for those who desire to safeguard their 
            investment capital against, and to make money from, the fluctuations in the 
            priced of stocks dealt in on the New York Stock Exchange or any other organized 
            exchange. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is applicable as well to bonds, preferred stocks and the leading commodity markets. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone who buys or sells a stock, a bond or a commodity for profit is 
            speculating if he employs intelligent foresight. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If he does not, he is gambling. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Your purpose should be to become intelligent, scientific and successful
            investor and trader. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This Method is for those who have had either little or no experience 
            operating in the stock market, or for those who have had much experience but 
            who have never been shown the real rules of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Out of the very limited number who really understand the inner workings 
            of the stock market, practically no one has been willing to show the public the 
            real inside. I believe it is time for someone to step forward and do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            The appalling losses, in securities, suffered annually by millions of people, 
            are enough to make the angels weep.
        </p>
        <p>
            These losses are the direct result of stock market plunging by people, 
            most of whom do not realize what they are risking, and who have an amazingly 
            small knowledge of the market. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That the American public needs help in its security market operations 
            there can be no question. I believe the best way to help people is to show
            them how to help themselves; and so I am here offering the cream of what I have 
            learned in forty years of active experience in Wall Street.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the methods herein explained, I have made a great deal of money for 
            myself and my clients and subscribers who numbered in excess of 200,000. By 
            making this available to those who desire to learn the business or trading and 
            investing in stocks — for it is a business just like law, medicine, or any other — I 
            hope to be of still greater service, not only to my former patrons, but to others 
            who have not had an opportunity to invest under favorable conditions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After you have learned this Method, you can devote half an hour, an 
            hour, all day or as much time, as you like, to forecasting the market, selecting 
            the best stocks in which to make commitments and the best time to buy and sell.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can learn from this how to develop independent judgment, so that you 
            need never ask anyone's opinion or listen to anyone's tips, or take anybody's 
            advice. You can so train your judgment that you will know just what to do and 
            when to do it. When you are in doubt you will do nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not claim that you can be invariably right. No one could. What I aim 
            to do is to show you how to be right in the majority of instances. This will require 
            close study and self-training on your part. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I will teach you how to read the market from your daily newspaper; from 
            the tape of the stock ticker; from your charts, or any or all combined. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I will teach you to plan your stock market campaigns just as a general 
            plans his battles.
