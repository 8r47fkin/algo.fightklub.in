		<h1>Forms of Charts</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Most of the principal moves in the market are made by large operators, 
            well informed insiders, bankers and pools, whose work we must detect and 
            follow. Practicably every stock has market sponsorship, although a stock's 
            sponsors may not always be active in it (Sect. 14M, Pg. 12).
        </p>
        <p>
            When important interests are accumulating a line of stock, a study of 
            the transactions will frequently disclose the fact; not in every case, but in the 
            majority. The more important the operations, the more easily are they discovered 
            by studying the price movement, the volume, the activity and the behavior 
            of stocks as the transactions appear on the tape.
        </p>
        <p>
            An experienced tape reader can, without memoranda of any sort, carry 
            in his head the movements of a number of stocks over many weeks and months 
            and is able to give an opinion as to the present stage of the principal sponsor's 
            operations. But there is a better way than this — an easier, more accurate and 
            more reliable method of tracing these large, inside operations, so as to derive a 
            profit and capital appreciation for the individual investor. I refer to the use of 
            charts, or graphs, as some call them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charts are merely the tape transactions in graphic form. They record 
            market history. All transactions appear first on the ticker tape, from which 
            they are tabulated by the newspapers and printed in the morning and evening 
            editions. You, can, from the tape, or preferably from the newspapers and your 
            charts, secure all the information you need to study the market, and operate in 
            it effectively and profitably.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charts have actual forecasting value because they indicate supply and 
            demand (pressure and support), the volume of trading and the time factor. 
            They form a concrete record of the forces lifting and depressing prices. There 
            is nothing so good for this purpose as charts. All the large interests in the
            Street for decades back have kept records of the market and of individual stocks 
            in chart form. Whenever anyone says it is foolish to keep charts, or to use them 
            in judging the market, you may put that person down as uninformed and either 
            unwilling to learn or incapable of interpreting chart records intelligently. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the popular prejudice against charts undoubtedly is due to the fact 
            that many people mistakenly attempt to use charts mechanically — without 
            judgment. They endeavor to draw diagrams or imaginary geometrical patterns on 
            their charts, or apply arbitrary rules or systems such as “oscillators” and other 
            impractical notions. Such methods are wrong. They lead only to errors, losses 
            and discouragement. Therefore, you must remember this:- When you study charts 
            look for the motive behind the action which the chart portrays. Aim to interpret 
            the behavior of the market and of stocks not the fanciful patterns ("gaps," 
            "horns," "flags," "pennants," etc.) which the charts may accidentally form. 
        </p>
        <p>
            One who understands how to interpret charts correctly can usually decide 
            whether the whole market, or any single stock, or group of stocks, is most likely 
            to advance, decline or stand still. Every market and every stock is always in a 
            bullish, bearish or neutral position (Sect. 18M, Pg. 4, Par. 3). The person who 
            can determine, with a high percentage of accuracy, the position in which the 
            market, or a group, or a certain stock stands, holds the key to success in trading 
            and investing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Selecting the Charts Best Suited to Your Purpose: It may seem at first that 
            an unnecessary number of charts are herein suggested, but remember that I am 
            explaining this Method, without knowing just what experience, knowledge and 
            practice you have had in the market. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am describing to you all of the records that may be used, and depending 
            upon your selecting therefrom what you find of most value for your individual 
            requirements. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It has always been my rule to reduce the number, of my own charts to 
            the minimum. When I was doing by best work I discarded everything but a 
            vertical line chart of the daily average of 50 stocks, with volumes, and the figure 
            charts of about 150 leading stocks, depending for the balance of my deductions 
            upon study of the stock ticker tape. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After you have studied and practiced with some or all of the charts I have 
            suggested, you can select those you need for your individual purpose. If you do 
            not have access to a stock ticker and desire to invest for the intermediate and 
            major moves, it would be best for you to keep both types of charts mentioned 
            below, together with the Wave chart of Tape Readings described in a later section. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Method we use three kinds of charts: Vertical Line Charts, Figure 
            Charts and a Wave Chart. 
        </p>
        <p>
            VERTICAL CHARTS are made by drawing a vertical line to indicate the 
            range of a stock, from high to low, in a single Stock Exchange session. This 
            includes fractions; that is, the exact high and low points are recorded on the 
            chart (see illustrations on pages 4 and 5).
        </p>
        <p>
            The closing price for the day should be indicated by a short horizontal 
            line, and each day's closing line may or may not be joined to that of the preceding day. 
            The day's transactions represent all the pulling and hauling between 
            bulls and bears for that session, and the closing price indicates the net result of 
            the day's battle — a gain or a loss, therefore the closing marks (or lines joined, 
            so that they make a continuous line) indicate the net progress of the market. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Volumes for each day's trading are recorded by a vertical line extending 
            up from the bottom of the sheet, with a scale at the side. (See illustrations). On 
            Saturdays the letter S may be placed above the volume for that day so that the 
            volume of transactions for the two hour session may be distinguished from 
            the volume of the five hour sessions. (Sect. 19M, Pg. 6, Footnote.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Advantages of a Vertical Chart: It is easily made from the transactions 
            in your newspaper or from the data recorded on our Daily Stock Chart Reports. 
            These show the price movement — highest, lowest and closing, and the volume. 
            From this -price movement alone we are able to judge the supply and demand, 
            the points of resistance and support, and the trend. The volume (number of 
            shares dealt in) indicates the intensity of the trading and the quality of the 
            buying and selling, and is a further essential aid in judging supply and demand.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Time Factor is also important because it enables us to estimate the 
            speed of the advances and declines — whether the buying or selling is urgent or 
            leisurely; whether it is slow or rapid accumulation, or distribution. The studies 
            which follow in succeeding sections will explain this in a practical way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From the volume and the price movement we find the greatest aid: (a) in 
            determining the direction of coming moves; (b)deciding when to buy or sell, when 
            to go long or short; (c) when a stock is on the springboard, and (d) when a move 
            is culminating. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Daily Vertical Charts are made to record the daily movements and 
            volume of the averages, or groups or individual stocks. By the use of these 
            charts, we are better able, to discern accumulation, distribution and other 
            phases of manipulative (controlled) or uncontrolled moves in the market. By 
            condensing them into weekly, and monthly vertical charts we are able to 
            visualize the long time trend and to keep our perspective of the long range 
            moves. However, the daily chart is most generally used because of its greater 
            sensitivity and immediate historical value. In other words, weakly and monthly 
            vertical charts aid us to judge the market's present position in relation to the 
            general trend, that is, the major bull and bear cycles; but daily charts are more 
            effective for timing commitments advantageously and for recognizing turning 
            points.
        </p>
        <p>
            FlGURE CHARTS are equally valuable, but it is best to use these in combination with 
            vertical charts, so that all obtainable deductions may be made
            therefrom. Figure charts take no account of fractions, nor do they take account 
            of time or volume. They represent the movement of a stock from one full figure 
            to the next full figure above or below, such as from 35 to 36 or 34. (See instructions 
            for making figure charts, pages 9 to 14.) They are of great value in 
            estimating the probable extent of supply and demand and the points of resistance 
            and support. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From the general formations (not so-called patterns such as “saucers,” 
            “baskets,” “fulcrums,” etc., which are popular with some purely theoretical technicians) 
            on the figure charts we are able to detect accumulation or distribution, 
            and we see clearly marked, the lines of support and supply. We can also identify 
            the marking up and marking down periods to excellent advantage by means of 
            these charts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most valuable feature of Figure Charts, however, is their horizontal 
            formations, which, in many cases forecast the approximate number of points a 
            stock, or a group, or the average should move. (Sections 10M to 13M.)
        </p>
        <p>
            It is in these horizontal formations, or congestion areas, on the figure 
            chart that we find the greatest aid: (a) in determining how far a stock should 
            go; (b) when it meets opposition, viz., when it has about reached the end of 
            its move; and with the help of the vertical chart (c) determining the trend, 
            and (d) when a stock is on the springboard. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Figure Charts may be made: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    From the fluctuations as they appear on the ticker tape. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the Report of Stock Sales on the New York Stock Exchange, a 
                    sheet that is published after the close of each session. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the Daily Stock Chart Reports which we will mail, to you each 
                    day, containing the one point fluctuations of more than 200 leading, active 
                    stocks. This service will be furnished gratis for six months. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    From the opening, highest, lowest and closing prices which appear in 
                    your daily newspaper; or from vertical charts. 
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Tape shows every transaction that takes place on the Stock Exchange 
            floor. In order to build figure charts therefrom it is necessary to watch the 
            tape continuously for five hours on five days a week, and two hours on Saturdays, 
            so that every fluctuation in the full figures will be recorded on your 
            figure chart. This is an easy matter if one is watching only a few stocks, but 
            as the number increases, you may find it necessary to have some assistance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Sales Sheet, or Report of Stock Sale's, can be procured from Francis 
            Emory Fitch, Inc. under authorization of a New York Stock Exchange member; it 
            is available about 2 1/2 to 3 hours after the market closes. These sheets contain 
            all the transactions that appear on the tape during the day, arranged so that one 
            can easily run through the different prices at which all the stocks on the list are 
            dealt in, beginning with the opening transaction and including all those that 
            follow, in the order in which they occur. This is the equivalent of reading the 
            tape one stock at a time. It requires but a few moments for each stock, to record 
            the full figure transactions for a day. These sales sheets serve the same purpose 
            as the tape when it comes to building figure charts. One can find them in his 
            broker's offices in New York and he can stop in and get what he wants from 
            them early the next morning following publication. Or, his broker will subscribe 
            to these Sales Sheets for him and mail them to him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Daily Stock Chart Reports contain every one point fluctuation in a 
            selected list of more than 200 leading, active stocks; the New York Times, the 
            New York Herald Tribune and the Dow-Jones averages; the Wyckoff Group 
            Averages; and the principal commodities; together with the volume and daily 
            price range data. This makes it possible for you to keep Vertical and Figure 
            Charts on all or any number of the most representative stocks and averages with 
            little trouble and expense. A further advantage of these reports is their accuracy 
            and the prompt correction of errors which may occasionally occur but which generally 
            are not corrected in other sources
        </p>
        <p>
            The Figure Chart, as we have stated, takes no account of anything except 
            the full figures. Fractions are discarded, as they are of no value in these calculations. 
            If you start with a stock which is selling at 50, you pay no attention 
            to any fluctuations except those of a full point or more from that figure. Your 
            next entry after 50 would be either 51 or 49, and after the latter figure is 
            recorded, you would record nothing until the stock sells at 50 or 48. When any 
            full figure is skipped, that is, when there are no sales between say 50 and 53, 
            you would record 51, 52 and 53 just as though there were sales at each of 
            these full figures. But if it rose to only 52 7/8 you would not record 53 until it 
            sold there. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To Make a 1 Point Figure Chart, your procedure should be as follows: 
            The stock stands at 50. It goes to 52. You would, therefore, enter the 51 and 52 
            in the same vertical column as, and above, the 50, thus:
        </p>
        <code>
            52
            51
            50
        </code>
        <p>
            It then declines to 45, or even to 44 1/8, but does not touch 44. You would 
            enter in the next column to the right 51, 50, 49, 48, 47, 46 and 45, thus: 
        </p>
        <code>
            52
            51  51
            50  50
                49
                48
                47
                46
                45
        </code>
        <p>
            It rallies to 49 or to 49 7/8, but does not reach 50 therefore, you would 
            enter in the third right-hand column 46, 47, 48 and 49, thus:
        </p>
        <code>
            52
            51  51
            50  50
                49  49
                48  48
                47  47
                46  46
                45
        </code>
        <p>
            A dip to 48 would call for an entry at that figure in the fourth right-hand column and a ral1y to 49 an entry of that figure just about the 48 thus:
        </p>
        <code>
            52
            51  51
            50  50
                49  49  49
                48  48  48
                47  47
                46  46
                45
        </code>
        <p>
            Next a dip to 46 1/4, which calls for an entry of 48 and 47 in the fifth 
            column. A rally to 48 3/4 and another dip to 46 l/8 requires two entries in the 
            sixth column. And so on as per the illustration below, and in the charts shown 
            elsewhere in this volume:
        </p>
        <code>
            52
            51  51
            50  50
                49  49  49
                48  48  48  48  48
                47  47      47  47
                46  46
                45
        </code>
        <p>
            The dotted lines drawn through the figures show the course of the market. 
            These lines, therefore, indicate how the chart should be made and how it should 
            be read. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dates are indicated on figure charts as follows: On the last day of each 
            month a circle is put around the last entry which appears on the chart for that 
            month, and the initial of the following month is entered a few spaces below the 
            circle in the same vertical column. For example, turn to the 1 point figure chart 
            of Bethlehem Steel on Page 12, Section 11M, and you will see that a circle is 
            marked around the figure 69 in the second column which means that this was 
            the last entry for the month of October, and just below that the letter N 
            indicates that November begins here. A little further on there is another
            circle with D under it. The circle indicates the end of November and the letter D 
            indicates that December begins here. Then the figure 51 is circled and below is an 
            entry J-31, which means that 51 was the last entry in December, 1930 and 
            January, 1931 begins here. The other months follow in the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a stock sells ex-dividend this may be indicated by making all of the 
            entries for that day in red, or some such distinguishing color. The amount of the 
            dividend is then entered in the same vertical column below the graph. If no full 
            figure change occurs on the day the stock sells ex-dividend, the list entry on the 
            chart should be retraced in red, or some other distinguishing color.

            To make a 1 point Figure Chart from your newspaper: Suppose you take a 
            stock which closed on Monday at 50. That would be your first figure on the figure 
            chart. Your newspaper records the fact that this stock opened today, Tuesday, let 
            us say, at 50 3/4 and went as high as 51 7/8; so you must record 51 on the 
            figure chart.. It does not go to 52. The lowest for the day was 45 3/4; hence after 
            it made the high at 51 it must have passed 46. You record on your figure chart 
            50, 49, 48, 47 and 46. The stick closed at 48 1/4, therefore it must have rallied 
            from the low of 46 to 48 and you would record 47 and 48 on your figure' chart 
            which would then look like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            51
            50  50
                49  49
                48  48
                47  47
                46
        </code>
        <p>
            Assume that Wednesday's transactions will show that the stock opened at 46 1/2, made a high of 49 1/8, a low of 45 and closed at 47. Your figure chart would call for an entry at 47 because the stock closed on Tuesday at 48, and to open at 46 1/2 it must have passed 47, which is the same as selling there. You find that the high of Wednesday was 49 1/8, the low 45, but you do not know which occurred first unless you watched the tape sufficiently to tell whether the high point of Wednesday occurred before the low point or vice versa. If you have not watched the tape, it would be well for you to ask your broker to look at his Sales Sheet and tell you when the stock was highest or lowest. Suppose the high point of the market Wednesday was in the morning. You must assume that your stock went to 49 1/2 after it touched 47. In this case you would make entries on the figure chart as follows: 48, 49. Then as the low of the day was 45, you must record 48 again, then 47, 46 and 45. And as the stock closed at 47 you would record 46 and 47.

            When completed, your two-days' figure chart would look like this:

            50  50
                49  49      49
                48  48  48  48  48
                47  47  47  47  47  47
                46              46  46

        <p>
            This is not so accurate a method as watching the tape, or using the Sales Sheet, or our Daily Stock Chart Reports; for your newspaper does not give you all of the fluctuations back and forth when a stock is oscillating, say between 45 and 47, once or twice in the day's session. But it is a reasonably good method if other means are not available.

            How to make a 3 Point Figure Chart. The 3 point figure chart condenses the history recorded on the 1 point chart-by discarding all reversals of less than three points. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following explanation will make this clear: Suppose we begin with a small section of a 1 point chart which shows a stock rising from 25 to 31, reacting to 30, then moving upward again to 32, as in Example A. In this, illustration, the rise from 25 to 32 is interrupted by a reversal of only one point.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, this reversal must be disregarded in making the 3 point chart which will simply show the net or total rise from 26 to 32 in one vertical column as in Example B.
        </p>

            Example A                       Example B

            31  31                          31
            30  30                          30
            29                              29
            28                              28
            27                              27

            Or suppose that the stock has moved straight up from 25 to 31, when its rise is interrupted by a reaction of two points to 29, after which it recovers and goes to a new high of 52, as in Example C. This reaction to 29 must be disregarded on the 3 point chart because it is a reversal of less than three points, so the 5 point chart (Example D) should show only the full movement from 25 to 32, the same as in Example B:

        <p>
            Developing our 1 point figure chart a little further, let us say it appears as shown in Example E. Our 3 point chart would then appear as shown in Example F, because after the stock has moved up from 25 to 31 and reacted to 29, its advance to 32 is followed by a three point reversal which forces us to move over to the next right-hand vertical column on our 3 point chart.

            Should the decline from 32 continue on the 1 point chart, without a swing of three points, or more in the opposite direction, we must continue to extend our entries in the second column of our 3 point chart until such a reversal of three points or more does occur, when we would move over to the next right — hand column, as in the following illustrations:
