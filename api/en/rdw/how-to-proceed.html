		<h1>How to Proceed</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            The following is recommended as a plan of study which should facilitate 
your progress and enable you to get the most out of this Instruction:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Read through the entire Course casually without attempting to study any 
                part of it. YOU will find numerous cross-references in the text. Disregard 
                these for the present. Let your, first casual reading be for the purpose of 
                gaining a general idea of the scope and presentation of the subject matter. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Read through the entire Course a second time, again, ignoring the cross references. 
                    This time, weigh the meaning of each paragraph more carefully, but do not attempt 
                    to dwell upon any part or section for more than 
                    a few minutes yet. Let the purpose of this second reading merely be to 
                    impress upon your mind more firmly the ideas you absorb as you go 
                    along. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If necessary, read the whole Course through a third time before you begin 
                    to concentrate on any particular part. By these repeated readings you will 
                    find that your memory will retain more firmly the ideas that are 
                    presented in each section. Then, when you do begin to study and analyze 
                    each paragraph intensively, you will have a clear understanding of the 
                    way in which the various parts, fit into, the complete philosophy of this 
                    Instruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bear in mind that everything in the Course is important. Nothing is 
                    superficial. Do not neglect those sections which are necessarily shorter, 
                    than others. Every paragraph is as much an integral part of the Course 
                    as any other paragraph. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                On your second or third reading, mark any paragraphs that may not be 
                clear to you. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Now study carefully Sections 4M and 6M and practice making vertical line 
                and figure charts, as explained in Section 4M, until you are sure that you 
                understand how to construct them properly. Should you have any difficulty 
                or doubts concerning the method of making the 1 or 3 point figure 
                charts or the vertical charts, consult our Coaching Staff — that is send us 
                samples of the charts you have made in accordance with your understanding 
                of the instructions and we shall be glad to check your work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Next, study and analyze carefully Sections 5M to 25M, inclusive, again 
                    marking any portions of the text which may not be clear to you. Make full 
                    use of all cross-references and - footnotes as you go along. 
                    The crossreferences are indicated thus: "Sect. —, Pg. —, Par. —,” which means that 
                    when you come to one of - these references you should turn to the 
                    Indicated section, page and paragraph and study it in conjunction with the 
                    text in the part of the Course where you are at the moment. Note that 
                    paragraph one begins on any given page, with the first indentation on 
                    that page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For instance, turn to Page 2, Section 3M. Paragraph 1 begins with the 
                    fifth line from the top of the page, which reads "No one can deny, etc."; 
                    Paragraph 2 begins with the words "Tape Reading and Chart Reading, 
                    etc." The first four lines on the top of the page are the run-over from 
                    paragraph 5 on the preceding page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In all cases where charts are discussed, follow the instructions given in 
                    Section 7M (Pg. 2, Par. 3) for studying them alongside of the reading 
                    matter in the Course.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Review the portions of the text you may have marked as suggested in 
                items 3 and 5, above. If you still find that you do not understand them, 
                send us a list of these questions (referring to the proper section, page 
                and paragraph number) and any other questions, that I are puzzling 
                you, so we may clear up your difficulties. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, practice making up a Position Sheet and the Technical Position 
                Barometer, consulting freely the instructions contained in Sections 18M 
                and 19M.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will now be ready to test your ability to apply the principles you 
                have learned from this Course by making a series of paper trades.
            </li>
            <li>
                After you have completed the above steps, one by one, if you have trouble, 
                in applying any of the principles, or if your paper trades do not develop 
                according to expectations, you are urged to select a paper trade, 
                that illustrates your difficulty and submit it to us. Be sure to include a 
                statement showing when and at what price you bought or sold; where 
                you placed your stop, the technical position of the stock as you 
                understood it at the time you entered the trade; and an outline of the 
                reasoning you employed in arriving at your decision to make the trade. 
            </li>
            <li>
                It will be advisable also for you to send us copies of your Position 
                Sheets and Records of Paper Trades for review and criticism. Please use 
                the short forms of these records which are furnished you for the 
                purpose of securing this additional instruction. Do not fail to accompany 
                these records with full outline of your own reasons for your decisions. 
            </li>
            <li>
                As you gain proficiency in the application of this Instruction and acquire 
                experience in the interpretation of market action, you will find an 
                occasional review of your Course extremely beneficial. As your 
                knowledge of stock market technique increases, your Course will acquire 
                increasing value as a reference work. Therefore, do not lay it away —
                but consult it often. It not only will refresh your memory of vital 
                principles, but by constant review will awaken you to the discovery of 
                refinements and principles that may have escaped your notice on earlier 
                occasions.
