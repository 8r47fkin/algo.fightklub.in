		<h1>JUDGING THE MARKET BY ITS OWN ACTION</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            The business of Wall Street is to finance corporations and to sell the 
            securities — stocks and bonds — which result from this financing. Some 
            securities are good; others not so good. Those who manufacture and sell them to the 
            public know their value best. The public has comparatively little idea of their 
            real value, except seasoned securities — those which have been on the market 
            for a long time and which, therefore, have established earning power and intrinsic value
        </p>
        <p>
            In every case the banker who does the financing and the dealers who help 
            him distribute, have paid for their securities either in cash or in services, or 
            underwritten them. The object is to market these stocks and bonds at as high 
            prices as possible. This marketing is done through distributing houses and syndicates, 
            by private sale, by public offering, and by means of listing on the stock 
            exchanges.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the latter case, the stock is advertised by making it active on the tape. 
            If the price be advanced, and the transactions made large, the activity attracts 
            buyers, and those who are handling the stock are thus able to dispose of their 
            shares.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sponsorship is continued after the market is thus made for a company’s 
            shares. The bankers operate for themselves, or others operate for them. After a 
            stock is floated, its sponsors try to create a stable market and support the price 
            as well as they can without taking back too much stock. When it is thoroughly 
            distributed and enough people are interested in the stock to make a market which 
            takes care of itself, under ordinary conditions, the original banker, syndicate or 
            sponsor may discontinue operations and turn attention to some other which 
            affords a new opportunity for money-making. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Other interests may begin operations in that stock. Generally speaking,
            there are usually one or more sponsors or large operators working in every 
            stock. Sometimes there are many. These interests see opportunities for profit, 
            accumulate a line, mark up the price when conditions are favorable, and then 
            sell out. Or they may sell short, depress the price and cover. 
        </p>
        <p>
            No one can deny that in Wall Street the, big fish eat the little ones. 
            Large operators could not operate successfully without the large number of 
            people making up the public; that is, if there were only ten big interests in the 
            market and no public, these ten could only make a profit by dealing with each 
            other. It would be difficult for one crowd to deceive any of the nine others. But 
            when the public enters the stock market, the large operator's game becomes 
            easier for him.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tape Reading and Chart Reading, enable one to detect and profit by 
            these inside operations or manipulation; to judge the future course of stocks, 
            by weighing the relation of supply and demand. This sometimes can be done 
            from price movement alone, but if you consider also the volume of the 
            transactions you gain an additional and vitally important helpful factor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By accurately judging this supply and demand, you are able to decide 
            the trend of the whole market and of certain stocks; also which stocks to buy 
            or sell, and, what is even more important, when to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
            You always aim to select the most promising opportunities; that is, the 
            stocks which are likely to move soonest, fastest and farthest. You make no 
            commitments without sound reasons, and you avoid undue risks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you study the tape or a chart, consider what you see there 
            as an expression of the forces that lift and depress prices. Study your charts 
            not with an eye to comparing the shapes of the formations, but from the 
            viewpoint of the behavior of the stock; the motives of those who are dominant 
            in it; and the successes and failures of the buyers and sellers as they struggle 
            for mastery on every move.
        </p>
        <p>
            The struggle is continuous. The tape shows all this in detail. The charts 
            enable you to pick the market apart and study whatever portion or phase of it 
            you choose. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Supply and demand may be studied on the tape of the stock ticker, and 
            to even better advantage from charts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The tape is like a moving picture film. Every minute of the day it is 
            demonstrating whether supply or demand is the greater. Prices are constantly 
            showing strength or weakness: strength when buyers predominate and 
            weakness when the offerings overpower the buyers. All the various phases 
            from dullness to activity; from strength to weakness; from depression to 
            boom, and from the top of the market down to the bottom — all these are 
            faithfully recorded on the tape. All these movements, small or great, 
            demonstrate the workings of the law of supply and demand. By transferring to 
            the charts portions of what appears on the tape, for study and forecasting 
            purposes, one is more readily enabled to make deductions with accuracy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And now that you are undertaking to learn this Method it is best that 
            you prepare your mind for it by discarding most of the factors that you have 
            heretofore employed in forming your judgment and making your decisions, 
            such as: tips, rumors, news items, newspaper and magazine articles, analyses, 
            reports, dividend rates, politics and fundamental statistics; and especially the 
            half-baked trading theories which are expounded in boardrooms and popular 
            books on the stock market. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not necessary for you to consider any of these factors because the 
            effect of all of them is boiled down for you on the tape. Thus the tape does for 
            you what you are unable to do for yourself: it concentrates all these elements 
            (that other people use as a basis for their stock market actions) into the combined 
            effect of their buying and selling. You draw from the tape or from your 
            charts the comparatively few facts which you require for your purpose. These 
            facts are: (l) price movement, (2) volume, or the intensity of the trading, (3) 
            the relationships between price movement and volume and (4) the time required 
            for all the movements to run their respective courses. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You are thus far better equipped than the man who is supplied with all 
            the financial news, statistics, etc. from the whole world.
        </p>
        <p>
            I, therefore, claim that:
        </p>
        <p>
            You need never read anything on the financial page of your newspaper 
            except the table of stock prices and volumes.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need pay no attention to the news, earnings, dividend rates or 
            statements of corporations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You need never study the financial or the business situation.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need not understand railroad or industrial statistics, the money 
            market, the crop situation, the bank statements, foreign trade or the political 
            situation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can absolutely ignore all the thousands of tips, rumors, reports and 
            especially the so-called inside information that flood Wall Street. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can discard all of these completely and finally. 
        </p>
        <p>
            UNLESS YOU DO THIS YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO GET THE BEST RESULTS 
            FROM YOUR MARKET OPERATIONS.
