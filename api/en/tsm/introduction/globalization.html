		<h2>Maturing Markets and Globalization</h2>
		<p>
			The level of noise in each market can tell us about the
maturity of that market and the nature of traders actively
using it. The U.S. equity markets are where companies
go to finance their business. Typical U.S. workers
participate in the equity markets indirectly through their
retirement program, and many are actively involved in
making the decisions where to allocate those funds. The
most conservative choose government debt obligations,
such as 5-year Treasury notes or municipal bonds; more
aggressive investors may allocate a portion to
professionally managed funds. Some may actively trade
their investment using ETFs, individual stocks, or
futures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Workers in other countries are not as involved in their
equity markets, even though movement of the equity
index in these countries reflects the health of their
economy. With less involvement, there is less liquidity
and with that, less price noise. However, most world
markets are becoming more active, even if that liquidity
comes from globalization, where traders from one
country buy and sell shares in another country.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can look at the way price noise has changed over the
20 years from 1990 to 2010 to see the maturity of the
world markets, shown in Figure 1.5. As a benchmark,
North America shows noise increasing each of the five
years, and the highest noise of all regions. Europe and
Australia follow close behind. Eastern Europe shows a
rapid change from low to high noise, indicating a surge
in trading activity. Latin America has the lowest level of
noise (the highest value) but is represented only by
Mexico. In general, the level of noise has increased as
globalization has increased.
		</p>
		<p>
			For traders, emerging markets have lower liquidity and
less noise. Trend systems work well until noise increases.
It is only the lack of liquidity, and often difficulty in
accessing these markets, that prevent traders from
capturing large profits.
		</p>
		<p>
			Asia continues to be the most important area of world
development. China, which holds most of the U.S. debt,
has given a great deal of economic freedom to its people,
but limited access to the equity markets for outside
investors. Figure 1.6, which is ranked from higher to
lower noise values (less maturity to more maturity) from
left to right shows the relative development of the Asian
equity markets. It is not surprising that Japan is the
most developed, followed by Hong Kong, Singapore,
South Korea, and Taiwan. These represent the most
open economies in Asia. At the other end are Sri Lanka,
Vietnam, Pakistan, and Malaysia, countries without
access to global investors. India's Sensex shows greater
participation than the China Shanghai Composite, but
both are toward the center of the ranking. As more
traders have access to these markets, as they should in
the future, they will move toward the right in the
ranking.
