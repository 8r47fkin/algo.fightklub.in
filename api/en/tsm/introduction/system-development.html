		<h2>System Development Guidelines</h2>
		<p>
			Before starting, there are a few guidelines that can help
make the task of developing a trading system easier.
			<ol>
				<li>Know what you want to do before you start.</li>
				Base your trading on a sound premise. It could be an
observation of how prices move in response to
government policy, a theory about how prices react
to economic reports, or simply a pattern that shows
up at the same time each day or each month. This is
the underlying premise of your method. It cannot
be discovered by computer testing. It comes from
the experience of observing price movement,
reminiscent of Jesse Livermore, and understanding
the factors that drive prices. If that's not possible,
then select ideas from credible books or articles.
				<li>State your idea or premise in its simplest form.</li>
				The more complex, the more difficult it will
be to evaluate the answer and to understand the
interaction of the parts. Simple methods tend to
have more longevity. Remember Occam's razor.
				<li>Do not assume anything.</li>
				Many projects fail on
basic assumptions that were incorrect. It takes
practice to avoid making assumptions and to be
critical of certain elements that you believe to be
true. Verify everything.

				<li>Try the simplest and most important parts first.</li>
				Some of the rules in your trading program will
be more important than others. Try those first. It's
best to understand how each rule or technique
contributes to the final system. Then build slowly
and carefully to prove the value of each element of
the system. The ability to readily understand the
operation of each part of your system is called a
transparent solution, rather than a fully integrated
or complex one. Transparent solutions are very
desirable.
				<li>Watch for errors of omission.</li>
				It may seem odd
to look for items that are not there, but you must
continually review your work, asking yourself if you
have included all the necessary costs and accounted
for all the risk. Simply because all the questions
were answered correctly does not mean that all the
right questions were asked.

				<li>Question the good results.</li>
				There is a tendency
to look for errors when results are bad, but to accept
the results that are good. Exceptionally good results
are just as likely to be caused by errors in rules,
formulas, or data. They need to be checked as
carefully as bad results. “Surprisingly good” results
are often wrong.

				<li>Do not take shortcuts.</li>
				It is sometimes
convenient to use the work of others to speed up the
research. Check their work carefully; do not use it if
it cannot be verified. Check your spreadsheet
formulas manually. One error can ruin all your hard
work.
				<li>Start at the end.</li>
				Define your goal and work
backward to find only the necessary input. In this
way, you only work with information relevant to the
results; otherwise, you may expend a lot of
unnecessary effort.

				<li>Be tenacious.</li>
				Not all ideas work the first time, or
the second. If you believe that your idea is good,
keep working at it. There might be a “bug” in your
code, or you might have omitted a rule that will
make it successful.
