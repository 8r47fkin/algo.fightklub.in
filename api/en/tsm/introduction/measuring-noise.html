		<h2>Measuring Noise</h2>
		<p>
			Noise is the erratic movement that makes up the pattern
of any price series. High noise can be compared to a
drunken sailor's walk while low noise is a straight line
from the starting to the ending point. Understanding the
effects of noise can give you a trading edge. A market
that has high noise is good for mean-reverting and
arbitrage strategies. One with low noise favors trendfollowing. By selecting markets correctly, you increase
your chances of success.
		</p>
		<p>
			Noise can be measured as price density, efficiency ratio
(also called fractal efficiency), and fractal dimension. It
is important that these measurements do not reflect
volatility because noise should not be confused with
volatility. In Figure 1.2 a short, hypothetical period of
price movement gives an example of noise measured by
the efficiency ratio (ER). ER is calculated by dividing the
net move (the change from point A to point B) by the
sum of the individual moves during that period, each
taken as positive numbers.

end at the same point. The straight line shows no noise,

			Figure 1.3 illustrates the relative level of noise that might
occur with a price move of the same net change. The
straight line indicates no noise, the smaller changes that
move above and below the straight line would be
medium noise, and the large swings are high noise.
However, in this example it is not possible to distinguish
the level of noise from volatility, yet they are not the
same. In Figure 1.4, the net change in price is from 440
to 475 in one case and from 440 to 750 in the other, yet
the sum of the individual component changes is similar,
595 and 554. The efficiency ratio is 0.06 for the first and
0.56 for the second, showing that the first is very noisy
while the second has relatively low noise (see Table 1.1).
Noise is always relative to the net price change. If prices
are moving up quickly, then even large swings may not
be considered “noisy.”

			FIGURE 1.4 By changing the net price move we can
distinguish between noise and volatility. If the sum of
the individual price changes are the same, but the net
move is larger, then the noise is less.
		</p>
		<p>
			TABLE 1.1 These price changes, reflecting the
patterns in Figure 1.4, show that larger
individual price changes do not correspond to
higher noise if the net change over the entire
period is much larger.

		<h3>Other Measurements of Noise</h3>
		<p>
			The previous example of noise used the efficiency ratio;
however, price density and fractal dimension may also be
used. Intuitively, price density can be seen as the extent
to which prices fill a box. If we take a 10-day period of
price movement charted with highs and lows, and draw a
box touching the highest high and lowest low, then the
density is how much of that box is filled. It is measured
as:
			<p>
				<img src="/api/en/tsm/introduction/8.png" alt="" width="100%">
			</p>
			Fractal dimension cannot be measured exactly but can
be estimated over n days using the following steps:
			<ol>
				<li>Max = highest high over n days</li>
				<li>Min = lowest low over n days</li>
				<li>Range = max - min</li>
				<img src="/api/en/tsm/introduction/9.png" alt="" width="100%">

			</ol>
			There is a strong relationship between fractal dimension
and the efficiency ratio (fractal efficiency), and there is a
similarity in the construction of price density and fractal
dimension. Of the three methods of measuring noise, the
efficiency ratio seems to be the clearest and that will be
used in the following analyses.
<h3>Impact on Trading</h3>
<p>
	Without preempting the discussion in Chapter 20
(“Trends and Price Noise”), a trend system will be more
profitable when the price series has less noise, and a
mean reversion strategy will be better when there is
more noise. That is not to say the noise is the only factor
that determines the outcome; however, selecting the best
markets to trade gives you a better chance of success.
Noise applies equally to all time frames because it
measures erratic price movement. In that regard, it
satisfies the concept of fractals, which are repeated in the
same way at all levels of detail.
</p>
On a macro level, noise can help choose which markets
to trade. On a micro level, it can tell you whether to enter
a market quickly or wait for a better price.
