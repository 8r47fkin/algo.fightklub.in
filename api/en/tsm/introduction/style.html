		<h2>Deciding on a Trading Style</h2>
		<p>
			It may seem backward to talk about a trading style in
advance of reading all the material, but many traders
have already decided that they want to day trade or hold
long-term positions because it suits their disposition,
their belief of what moves prices, or their time schedule.
That's important because you must be comfortable with
the way you trade. With that in mind, short-term and
long-term traders will focus on different strategies and
markets while portfolio structure and risk control will be
much the same for either approach.
		</p>
		<p>
			To understand how markets and different trading styles
work together, consider a daily chart of any market, an
individual stock, a short-term interest rate futures
contract, or the sector SPDR SPY. There are periods of
trending and sideways patterns. However, if you change
that chart from intraday to daily, and from daily to
weekly, the longer-term trend emerges. Lower frequency
data makes the trend clearer. Figure 1.1 shows crude oil
weekly, daily, and 20-minute charts, centered around
July 2008. The weekly chart shows the smoothest
pattern, the daily adds a few extra reversals, and the 20-
minute chart has some abrupt changes on the open of
the day.

			Selecting a price frequency that complements your
trading strategy is important. If you are a long-term,
macrotrend follower, then you want the price series that
shows more trends, which is improved by weekly or daily
charts. Short-term traders focus on mean reversion or
fast directional price moves, and those strategies are
enhanced using higher-frequency data, such as hourly or
15-minute bars.
