		<h2>Convergence of Trading Styles in Stocks and Futures</h2>
		<p>
			The development of technical analysis has taken a
different path for stocks and futures. This seems natural
because the two markets cater to investors with different
time frames and different commercial interests. At the
same time, those markets place very different financial
demands on the investor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The original users of the futures markets were grain
elevators and grain processors, representing the supply
side and the demand side. The elevators are the grain
wholesalers who bought from the farmers and sold to the
processors. The futures markets represented the fair
price and grain elevators sold their inventory on the
Chicago Board of Trade to lock in a price (hopefully a
profit). The processor, typically a bread manufacturer or
meat packer, used the futures markets to fix a low price
for their material cost and as a substitute for holding
inventory. Both producer (the sell side) and processor
(the buy side) only planned to hold the position for a few
weeks or a few months, until they either delivered their
product to market or purchased physical inventory for
production. There was no long-term investment, simply
a hedge against risk. Futures contracts, similar to stock
options, expire every two or three months and can be
held for about one year; therefore, it is nearly impossible
to “invest” in futures.
		</p>
		<p>
			One other critical difference between futures and stocks
is the leverage available in futures. When a processor
buys one contract of wheat, that processor puts up a
good faith deposit of about 5% of the value of the
contract. If wheat is selling for $10 a bushel and a
standard contract is for 5,000 bushels, the contract value
is $50,000. The processor need only deposit $2,500 with
the broker. The processor is essentially buying with
leverage of 20:1.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the 1970s, the futures trader paid a round-turn
commission of $50 per contract. This is about 0.3 of one
percent, less than the stock market cost of 1% per trade
at the time. Now, years after negotiated commissions
have become part of the system, the fee is no more than
$8, or 0.05 of one percent for either stocks or futures,
often less. Commission costs are so low that they are not
a consideration when trading futures. The same low
costs are also available to equity traders. Low costs allow
fast trading, even day trading. It has changed the way we
approach the markets.
