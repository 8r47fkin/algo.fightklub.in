		<h2>Profile of a Trading System</h2>
		<p>
			There are quite a few steps to be considered when
developing a trading program. Some of these are simply
choices in style while others are essential to the success
of the results. They have been listed here and are
discussed briefly as items to bear in mind as you
continue the process of creating or choosing a trading
system.
		</p>
		<h3>Changing Markets and System Longevity</h3>
		<p>
			Markets are not static. They evolve as does everything
else. The biggest changes continue to be in technology,
participation, globalization, new markets, and the cost of
doing business.
		</p>
		<p>
			Technology includes communications, trading
equipment (primarily computers and handheld devices),
electronic exchanges, data access, and order entry. These
innovations have accelerated the trading process.
Electronic markets have changed the nature of the order
flow and made information about buyers and sellers
more accessible. They have changed the speed at which
prices react to news, and they have facilitated highfrequency trading and smart executions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Globalization is mostly the result of the advances in
communications. Not only can we see the same news at
the same time everywhere in the world, but we can pass
on information just as quickly. Equally important, we do
not think about the reliability of our equipment. We
expect our computers, telephones, and Internet
connections to work without question. When we trade,
we are willing to bet on it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dramatic reduction in commission cost has been a
major influence on trading, opening opportunities for
the fast trader. For institutions, stock transactions can be
done at a fraction of a cent per share, and the individual
investor will pay no more than $8 per order and as little
as $1. This not only facilitates fast trading but
encourages greater participation. Everyone wins.
		</p>
		<p>
			The challenge for the trader is to find a system that will
adapt to as-yet-unknown changes in the future. Most
changes are not sudden, but are gradually reflected in
price patterns (alternating with an occasional price
shock). Biogenetic research has increased crop
production while global warming may do the opposite.
The rising middle class in China and India will change
the demand for energy and retail goods. The increase in
trading choices – ETFs, mutual funds, stocks, futures,
options – causes a complex interdependence of markets.
Index arbitrage and the trading of sector ETFs force the
component stocks to move in the same direction
regardless of their individual fundamentals. It is both
challenging and rewarding to create a program with
longevity.
		</p>
		<h3>The Choice of Data</h3>
		<p>
			System decisions are limited by the data used in the
analysis. Although price and volume for the specific
stock or futures market may be the definitive criteria,
there is a multitude of other valid statistical information
that might also be used. Some of this data is easily
included, such as price data from companies in the same
sector or industrial group, or the current yield curve
relationship. Other statistical data, including the wide
range of U.S. economic data and weekly energy
inventories, may add a level of robustness to the results
but are less convenient to obtain and less timely.
		</p>
		<h3>Diversification</h3>
		<p>
			Not all traders are interested in diversification, which
tends to reduce returns at the same time that it limits
risk. Concentrating all your resources on a single market
that you understand may produce a specialized approach
and much better results than using a more generalized
technique over more markets. Diversification may be
gained by trading two or more unique strategies applied
to the same market, instead of one strategy used on a
broad set of markets. On the other hand,
overdiversification can introduce marginal returns with
greater risk. It will be important to find the right
balance.
		</p>
		<h3>Trade Selection</h3>
		<p>
			Although a trading system produces signals regularly, it
is not necessary to enter all of them. Selecting one over
another can be done by a method of filtering. This can be
a confirmation of another technique or system, a
limitation on the amount of risk that can be accepted on
any one trade, the use of outside information, or the
current volume. Many of these additional rules add a
touch of reality to an automated process. You may find,
however, that too many filters result in overfitting or no
trading.
		</p>
		<h3>Testing</h3>
		<p>
			A mistake in testing may cause you to trade a losing
strategy or discard a profitable one. Back-testing is the
only option available to confirm or validate your ideas.
Testing is misguided when it is used to “discover” a
trading method by massive scanning of techniques. A
robust solution, one that works on many stocks or across
similar markets, will never appear as good as an
optimized result of a single stock. But using the same
system for all stocks in the same sector exposes it to
more patterns and will give you a more realistic
assessment of expectations, both risk and reward, and a
much better chance of success.
		</p>
		<h3>Risk Control</h3>
		<p>
			Trading survival requires risk control. Risk must be
addressed at all levels. It begins with the individual
trade, but must also balance the risks of all markets in a
common sector, the risk of those sectors in a portfolio,
and finally the risk of multiple systems traded together.
Trade risk can be controlled using a stop-loss but can
effectively be managed by volatility. Futures traders
must also pay attention to leverage. Risk management
does not need to be complex, but it cannot be
overlooked.
		</p>
		<h3>Transaction Costs</h3>
		<p>
			A system that performs well on paper may be dismal
when actually traded. Part of a trading program is
knowing how to enter and exit the market, as well as
having realistic expectations about the transaction costs,
both commissions and slippage. Short-term, fast trading
systems are most sensitive to transaction costs because
the expected profit on each trade is small. Directional
trading strategies, those that buy as prices are rising and
sell when they are falling, have larger slippage than mean
reversion techniques.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is equal damage in overstating costs as there is in
underestimating them. By burdening a system with
unrealistic fees, tests may show a loss instead of a profit,
causing you to reject a successful trading method.

		</p>
		<h3>Performance Monitoring and Feedback</h3>
		<p>
			A system is not done when you begin trading; it is only
entering a new phase. Trading results must be carefully
monitored and compared with expectations to know if
the system is performing properly. It is very likely that
knowing the true execution slippage will cause you to
make some changes to the system rules or to the size of
the positions. Performance monitoring provides the
essential feedback needed to be successful. It can be an
early warning that tells you something is wrong, or it can
give you added confidence that everything is going well.
