		<h2>A Line in the Sand between Fundamentals and Technical Analysis</h2>
		<p>
			The market is driven by fundamentals. These are often
			employment, GDP, inflation, consumer confidence,
			supply and demand, and geopolitical factors, all of which
			create expectations of price movement. But it is too
			difficult to trade using those facts, and economists have
			never been very accurate. Economic reports are not
			usually timely, and individual companies are not
			forthcoming about problems. We have had too many
			cases where the data we use to make fundamental
			decisions about individual companies have been
			unreliable, or a major computer breach isn't reported for
			months. We can add that to the conflict of interest
			inherent in the government's calculation of the
			Consumer Price Index, because an increase in the CPI
			requires that all those receiving Social Security checks
			get a cost-of-living increase.
		</p>
		<p>
			Technical analysis, when used to determine the longterm direction of prices, attempts to objectively evaluate
			these complex fundamentals. It is no different from the
			economists who use regression, seasonality, and cyclic
			analysis to forecast the economy. The technical trader
			can use those tools as well as chart trendlines, recognize
			patterns, and calculate probability distributions. Perhaps
			the economists are doing the same thing.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is well known that the Federal Reserve monitors
			trading and prices to decide how to time their interest
			rate changes and, when necessary, their currency
			intervention. All monetary authorities know that, when
			their currency is rising too fast, you don't try to stop it. If
			the public wants to buy the Japanese yen, the Central
			Bank doesn't have enough clout to halt it unless it first
			waits for the move to be exhausted. It must use its
			resources carefully, and it uses market know-how and
			price analysis to time its actions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The primary advantages of a technical approach are that
			it is objective and completely well-defined. The accuracy
			of the data is certain. One of the first great advocates of
			price analysis, Charles Dow, said:
		</p>
		<code>
			The market reflects 
			all the jobber knows about the condition of the textile trade; 
			all the banker knows about the money market; 
			all that the best-informed president knows of his own business, 
			together with his knowledge of all other businesses; 
			it sees the general condition of transportation in a way that
			the president of no single railroad can ever see; 
			it is better informed on crops than the farmer or even the Department of Agriculture. 
			In fact, the market reduces to a bloodless verdict all knowledge bearing on finance, 
			both domestic and foreign.
		</code>
		<p>
			Much of the price movement reflected in any market is
			anticipatory; it results from the expectations of the
			effects of macroeconomic developments or the outcome
			of good corporate management and new products.
			Markets, however, are subject to change without notice.
			For example, the government may block the merger of
			two companies, or approve or reject a new drug. A
			hurricane bound for the Philippines will send sugar
			prices higher, but if the storm turns off course, prices
			reverse. Anticipation of employment reports, housing
			starts, or corn production reports causes highly
			publicized expert estimates, which may correctly or
			incorrectly move prices before the actual report is
			released. Markets then react to the accuracy of the
			estimates rather than to the economic data itself. By the
			time the public is ready to act, the news is already
			reflected in the price.
