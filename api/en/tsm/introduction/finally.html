			Throughout this book the principle of unnecessary
plurality, better known as Occam's razor, will be
stressed. The principle states that, given more than one
explanation or solution, the simplest one is the
preferred. (Smart people have been around for a long
time.) When developing or choosing a trading strategy, it
is normally the case that adding complexity for the sake
of a few extra basis points increases the potential
problems and risk more than it increases returns.

			The goal here is to provide the tools and the
understanding to help both aspiring and experienced
traders develop systematic ways to trade that satisfy
their inherent risk preference and their investment
objectives. It is unlikely that any two traders will develop
the same system, but the greater their knowledge, the
more likely it will be profitable.
