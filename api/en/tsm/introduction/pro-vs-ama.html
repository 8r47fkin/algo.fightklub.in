		<h2>Professional and Amateur</h2>
		<p>
			Beginning technical traders may find a system or
technique that seems extremely simple and convenient
to follow, one that appears to have been overlooked by
the professionals. Most often there is a simple reason
why that method is not used. As you learn more about
trading, you find that execution is difficult, or the risk is
much higher than originally expected, or that the system
has too many losses in a row. Trading is a business, not
one to be taken casually. As Richard Wyckoff said, “Most
men make money in their own business and lose it in
some other fellow's.” Plan to invest your time before your
money, so that when you begin trading, you have more
realistic expectations.
		</p>
		<p>
			That does not mean that simple systems don't work, but
that each has a return and risk profile that is typical of
that style and difficult to change. One purpose of this
book is to present many different trading methods, each
with its own risk and reward profile, so that each trader
understands the true cost of trading.

			To compete with a professional speculator, you must be
accurate in anticipating the next move. This can be done
by
			<ul>
				<li>
					Recognizing recurring patterns in price movement
					and determining the most likely results of such
					patterns.
				</li>
				<li>
					Identifying the “trend” of the market by isolating the
					underlying direction of prices over a selected time
					interval.
				</li>
				<li>
					Exploiting an unusual divergence in price between
					two related companies or commodities, called
					arbitrage.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>The Tools</h3>
		<p>
			The bar chart, discussed in Chapter 3, is the simplest
representation of the market. These patterns are the
same as those recognized by Jesse Livermore, in the
early 1900s, on the tickertape. Because they are
interpretive, more precise methods such as point-andfigure charting came into being, which add a level of
exactness to charting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mathematical modeling, using traditional regression or
statistical analysis, remains a popular technique for
anticipating price direction. Most modeling methods are
variations on econometrics, basic probability, and
statistical theory. They are precise because they are
based entirely on numerical data; however, they need
trading rules to make them operational.
		</p>
		<p>
			The proper assessment of the price trend is critical to
most trading systems. Countertrend trading, which takes
a position opposite to the trend direction, is just as
dependent on knowing the trend. Large sections of this
book are devoted to the various ways to identify the
trend, although it would be an injustice to leave the
reader with the idea that a “price trend” is a universally
accepted concept. There have been many studies
claiming that price trends do not exist. The most
authoritative papers on this topic are collected in
Cootner, The Random Character of Stock Market Prices
(MIT Press, 1964); very readable discussions can be
found in the Financial Analysts Journal, an excellent
resource.
		</p>
		<p>
			Personal money management has an enormous number
			of tools, many of which can be found in Excel and other
			spreadsheet software. These include linear regression
			and correlation analysis. An Excel add-in, Solver, can
			easily be adapted to portfolio allocation. There is also
			inexpensive software to perform spectral analysis and
			apply advanced statistical techniques. Trading systems
			development platforms such as TradeStation and
			MetaStock provide programming languages and data
			management that greatly reduce the effort needed to
			implement your ideas. Professionals maintain the
			advantage of having all of their time to concentrate on
			the investment problems; however, nonprofessionals are
			no longer at a disadvantage.
