		<h2>Objectives of This Doc</h2>
		<p>
			This book is intended to give you a complete
understanding of the tools and techniques needed to
develop or choose a trading program that has a good
chance of being successful. Execution skill and market
psychology are not considered â€“ only the strategies, the
methods for testing those strategies, and the means for
controlling the risk. This is a goal of significant
magnitude.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not everything can be covered in a single book;
therefore, some guidelines were needed to control the
material included here. Every technique in this book
qualifies as systematic; that is, each has clear rules. Most
of them can be automated. We begin with basic concepts,
including definitions, how much data to use, how to
create an index, some statistics and probability, and
other tools that are used throughout the book. The next
several chapters cover the techniques that are most
important to trading, such as the trend and momentum.
All chapters are organized by common grouping so that
you can compare variations of the same basic method.
Although charting is an extremely popular technique, it
is included only to the degree that it can be compared
with other systematic methods, or when various patterns
can be used in a computerized program (such as
identifying a key reversal day). There has been no
attempt to provide a comprehensive text on charting;
however, various formations may offer very realistic
profit objectives or provide reliable entry filters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Neither stock options nor options on futures are
included in this book. The subject is too large and too
specialized. There are already many good books on
options strategies. The exception is that there are
strategies using VIX, and comparisons of implied
volatility versus historic volatility.
		</p>
		<p>
			This book does not attempt to prove that one system is
better than another, because it is not possible to know
what will happen in the future or how each reader will
cleverly apply these techniques. Instead the book
evaluates the conditions under which certain methods
are likely to do better and situations that will be harmful
to specific approaches. By grouping similar systems and
techniques together, and by presenting many of the
results in a uniform way, you should be able to compare
the differences and draw your own conclusions. Seeing
how analysts have modified existing ideas can help you
decide how to personalize a strategy and give you an
understanding of why you might choose one path over
another. With a more complete picture, common sense
should prevail over computing power.
