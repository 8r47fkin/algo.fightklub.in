		<h2>Background Material</h2>
		<p>
			The contents of this book assume an understanding of
the stock market and futures markets, such as the S&P
500 and Treasury notes. Futures markets have a great
impact on stock patterns and trade 24 hours a day. The
rules and mechanics of those markets are not explained
here unless they directly relate to a trading strategy.
Ideally the reader should have read one or more of the
available trading guides and should understand the
workings of a buy or sell order and the contract
specifications of futures. Experience in actual trading
would be helpful. It's an advantage if you enjoy playing
competitive games and that you like to win.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are excellent books available to both the beginning
and advanced trader. Jack Schwager's Complete Guide to
Futures Markets (2017) is a new edition of a classic, as
well as the popular Market Wizards (updated 2012). For
equities, the newest version of Edwards, Magee, and
Bassetti, Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, remains a
favorite. There are too many to name them all, so I'll tell
you the technical books that are in easy reach of my desk,
in alphabetic order by author's last name (details can be
found in the Bibliography): Carol Alexander, Market
Models; Peter Bernstein, The Portable MBA; Thomas
Bulkowski, Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns and The
Encyclopedia of Candlestick Patterns; John Ehlers,
Cycle Analytics for Traders; Mark Fisher, The Logical
Trader; John Hull, Fundamentals of Futures and
Options; Andrew Lo, Adaptive Markets; Edgar Peters,
Chaos and Order in the Capital Markets; and Cliff
Ragsdale, Statistical Modeling. Of course, there are my
own books, which I refer to often (see Bibliography).

		<p>
			Your list of worthwhile books should also include John
Bollinger, Bollinger on Bollinger Bands, and Martin
Pring, Technical Analysis Explained, as well as Robert
Colby, The Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators
(Dow Jones Irwin, 2002), Alex Elder, The New Trading
for a Living (Wiley, 2014), and Nassim Taleb, Fooled by
Randomness.
		</p>
		<p>
			For a constant flow of both classic and new techniques,
the magazines Technical Analysis of Stocks &
Commodities and Modern Trader have numerous
articles on trading systems and methods. A basic
understanding of market phenomena and relationships,
often requiring some math skill, can be found in the
Financial Analysts Journal (CFA Institute).
		</p>
		<p>
			Books that should be read by every trader, and are also
next to my desk, are Edwin Lefevre, Reminiscences of a
Stock; Sun Tzu, The Art of War; Charles MacKay,
Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of
Crowds; and my favorite, The Logic of Failure by
Dietrich Dörner. There are also books by Neil deGrasse
Tyson because my interest in the universe goes back to
my original career path.

		<h3>Blogs, User Groups, and Associations</h3>
		<p>
			Times have changed, and the Internet contains a great
deal of material on trading systems not published
elsewhere. It requires some sifting to locate information
that you find relevant, but there are useful ideas out
there. Just don't expect to find the golden chalice. You'll
need to take the ideas, develop them, and test them
yourself. Not all will be as good as they first appear. But
ideas are valuable. Scan for “Trading Systems blogs.”
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a number of associations and user groups that
can be very helpful to traders at all levels. The CMT
Association (renamed from the Market Technician's
Association) offers a Certified Market Technician
credential, and the CFA Institute (previously the
Association for Investment Management Research,
AIMR) offers the Charter Financial Analyst credential.
For those with higher math skills, the International
Association of Financial Engineers (IAFE) offers
excellent resources. There are also user groups,
sometimes called forums, for all of the popular
development platforms, such as TradeStation,
MetaStock, and Ninja Trader. These groups usually meet
in larger cities, but can be reached on social media and
are a valuable resource for solving a difficult problem.

			As for this book, a reader with a good background in
high school mathematics can follow everything but the
more complex parts. A basic course in statistics is ideal,
but knowledge of the type of probability found in Edward
Thorp's Beat the Dealer (Vintage, 1966) is adequate.
Fortunately, computer spreadsheet programs, such as
Excel, allow anyone to use statistical techniques
immediately, and most of the formulas in this book are
presented in such a way that they can easily be adapted
to spreadsheets, if they are not already presented that
way. Even better, if you have a computer with trading
software, you are well equipped to continue. If you have
a live data feed, such as Bloomberg, Reuters, or
Thinkorswim, you will also have access to technical
studies that you will find very helpful. Bloomberg and
Reuter's are also excellent sources of global data.
