			Let's start by defining the term technical analysis.
Technical analysis is the systematic evaluation of price,
volume, breadth, and open interest, for the purpose of
price forecasting. A systematic approach may simply use
a bar chart and a ruler, or it may use all the computing
power available. Technical analysis may include any
quantitative method as well as all forms of pattern
recognition. Its objective is to decide, in advance, based
on a set of clear and complete rules, where prices will go
over some future period, whether 1 hour, 1 day, or 5
years.

			Technical analysis is not just the study of chart patterns
or the identification of trends. It includes intermarket
analysis, complex indicators, and mean reversion, as well
as the testing process and the evaluation of test results. It
can use a simple moving average or a neural network to
forecast price moves. This book serves as a reference
guide for all of these techniques, puts them in some
order, and explains the functional similarities and
differences for the purpose of trading. It includes
portfolio construction and multilevel risk control, which
are integral parts of successful trading.
