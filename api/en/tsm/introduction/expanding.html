		<h2>The Expanding Role of Technical Analysis</h2>
		<p>
			Quantitative methods for evaluating price movement
and making trading decisions have become a dominant
part of market analysis. Those who do not actively trade
with methods such as overbought and oversold
indicators are most likely to watch them along the
bottom of their screen. The major financial networks are
always pointing out price trends and support and
resistance levels. They are quick to say that a price that
moves up or down was done on low volume, implying
that it might be unreliable. The 200-day moving average
seems to be the benchmark for long-term direction, and
the 50-day for short-term.

			In 2002 the U.S. government questioned the integrity of
the research produced by major financial houses that
have a conflict between financing/underwriting and
advising retail brokerage. The collapse of Enron caused
us to question the earnings, debt, quality of business,
and other company data released to the public by large
and small firms. When trading equities in other
countries, it is never clear that the financial data is either
correct or timely. But price and volume are always
accurate. It is not surprising that more quantitative
trading methods have been adopted by research firms. In
March 2017, Blackrock announced that it would
eliminate 40 portfolio managers in favor of algorithmic
stock selection. When decisions are made with clear
rules and calculations that can be audited, those analysts
recommending buys and sells are safe from scrutiny.

		<p>
			Extensive quantitative trading exists around the world.
Interest rate arbitrage is a major source of revenue for
banks. Location arbitrage is the process that keeps the
price of gold and other precious metals the same all over
the globe. Program trading keeps the collective price of
stocks in line with S&P futures and SPY (the SPDR ETF)
prices. These fully automated systems are now called
algorithmic trading.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you don't think of arbitrage as technical trading, then
consider market neutral strategies, where long and short
positions are taken in related markets (pairs trading) in
order to profit from one stock rising or falling faster than
the other. If you change your time horizon from hours
and days to milliseconds, you have high-frequency
trading. You might prefer to take advantage of the
seasonality in the airline industry or try your hand
trading soybeans. Both have clear seasonal patterns as
well as years when other factors (such as a disruption in
energy supply) overwhelm the seasonal factors. Trading
seasonal patterns falls under technical analysis.

		<p>
			Technology that allows you to scan and sort thousands of
stocks, looking for key attributes – such as high
momentum, a recent breakout, or other indicator values
– is technical analysis on a broad scale. High-frequency
trading has become a profit center for large financial
institutions, but involves placing computer equipment as
close to the source of the exchange price transmission as
possible – a contentious issue. High-frequency trading is
credited for adding liquidity by increasing volume in
equities, but has also been blamed for spectacular, highly
volatile price moves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most impressive is the increase in managed funds that
use technical and quantitative analysis. Many billions of
investment dollars are traded using trend-following,
timing techniques, mean reversion, and countless other
systematic methods. It is thought that well over half of
all managed money uses algorithmic trading. The use of
technical analysis has infiltrated even the most guarded
fundamental fortresses.
