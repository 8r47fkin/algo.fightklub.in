		<h2>A word about notation used in this doc</h2>
		<p>
			To make the contents of this book more useful for
trading, some of the traditional mathematical formulas
are also shown as Microsoft's Excel notation, as well as
TradeStation's EasyLanguage. EasyLanguage can be
understood by anyone who has experience with a
programming language, and is easily converted to other
development platform code. You will find hundreds of
examples on the Companion Website, with references to
them noted in the margins throughout the book.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the examples are more complex systems and
indicators, written in either, or both, Excel and
EasyLanguage. Although these programs have been
carefully tested, there may have been occasional errors
introduced during final editing. Recent market activity
may also produce combinations of price movements that
did not occur during the test period. Readers are advised
to check over the code and test it thoroughly before using
it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Be aware that the statistical functions may have slightly
different names in different platforms. For the standard
deviation, Excel uses stdev while EasyLanguage uses
stddev. One program expects the mean to be avg while
another requires average. Excel uses log when it's really
ln (natural log). Please check the notation in each
formula and solution so that it reflects your needs.
