		<h2>Random Walk</h2>
		<p>
			It has been the position of many advocates of
fundamental and economic analysis that there is no
relationship between price movements from one day to
the next. That is, prices have no memory of what came
before – this has been named the random walk theory.
Prices will seek a level that will balance the supply–
demand factors, but that level will be reached either
instantaneously, or in an unpredictable manner as prices
move in response to the latest available information or
news release.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the random walk theory is correct, the many welldefined trading methods based on mathematics and
pattern recognition will fail. There are two arguments
against random price movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first argument is simply the success of many
algorithmic trading strategies. There is definitive
documentation of performance for systematized
arbitrage programs, hedge funds, and derivatives funds,
showing success for upward of 40 years. This is not to
say that all technical programs are successful – far from
it. But neither are fundamental methods. You still need a
sound strategy, whether discretionary or systematic, in
order to be profitable. Not everyone can create and
implement such a strategy
		</p>
		<p>
			The second argument against the random walk is that
prices move on anticipation. One can argue academically
that all participants (the “market”) know exactly where
prices should move following the release of news.
However practical or unlikely this is, it is not as
important as market movement based on anticipation of
further news. For example, if the Fed lowered rates twice
this year and the economy has not yet responded, would
you expect it to lower rates again? Of course you would.
Therefore, as soon as the Fed announces a rate cut you
would speculate on the next rate cut. When most traders
hold the same expectations, prices move quickly to that
level. Prices then react to further news relative to
expectations, but only to the degree that investors have
confidence in their future forecast. Is this price
movement that conforms to the random walk theory?
No. But the actual pattern of price movement can appear
similar to random movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Excluding anticipation, the apparent random movement
of prices is dependent on both the time interval and the
frequency of data observed. Over a longer time span,
using lower frequency data (for example, weekly), the
trending characteristics become more obvious, along
with seasonal and cyclic variations. In general, the use of
daily data shows more noise (random movement) than
weekly or monthly data.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the long run, prices seek a level of equilibrium.
Investors will switch from stocks to bonds to futures if
one offers better return for the same risk. Investors are,
in essence, arbitraging the investment vehicles. To
attract money, an investment must offer more.
		</p>
		<p>
			Prices do not have a normal distribution, another fact
that argues against random walk. The asymmetry of the
index markets, in particular those built on traditional
stocks, is easy to understand because the public consists
overwhelmingly of buyers. When looking at price
movement in terms of “runs” – hours or days when
prices continue in the same direction for an unusually
long sequence – we find that price data, and the profits
that result from trending systems, have a fat tail,
representing much longer runs than can be explained by
a normal distribution. The existence of a fat tail also
means that some other part of the distribution must
differ from the norm because the extra data in the tail
must come from somewhere else. When we discuss
trending systems, the fat tail plays a critical role in
profitability.
		</p>
		<p>
			Price movement is driven by people, and people can buy
and sell for nonrandom reasons, even when viewed in
large numbers. People move prices and create
opportunities that allow traders to profit. The long-term
trends that reflect economic policy, normally identified
by quarterly data, can be of great interest to longer-term
position traders. It is the shorter-term price moves
caused by anticipation (rather than actual events),
frequent news releases, unexpected volatility, prices that
are far from value, countertrend systems looking for
price reversals, and shifts in supply and demand that are
the primary focus of this book.
