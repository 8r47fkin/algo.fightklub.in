		<h2>Standard Measurements of Performance</h2>
		<p>
			As important as standardizing risk and return is the need to compare the performance
of two funds or two trading models in order to decide which is best. That decision is
 normally made based on a combination of return and risk. The simplest and most practical of these measurements is the information ratio (IR)

 where both annualized returns and annualized risk (the same as annualized volatility)
have been given in the previous section of this chapter.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you compare performance using any return/risk ratio, you are looking for the
optimum point on the effi cient frontier. That is, any fund with a higher return but the
same risk will be preferable, and any fund with the same return but a lower risk will be
preferable.
		</p>
		<h3>Sharpe Ratio</h3>
		<p>
			The Sharpe ratio, presented by William F. Sharpe, is the most popular of all performance
measures. It differs from the more generic information ratio in that it isolates excess
 return by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the fund performance

		</p>
		<h3>Treynor Ratio</h3>
		<p>
			The Treynor ratio also isolates excess return; however, it replaces the annualized risk of
the fund or trading program with the beta of the portfolio. Beta is the volatility (risk) of
a stock relative a benchmark index, for example, the S&P. The portfolio beta is the sum
of the weighted individual stock betas within the portfolio. If the fund has a beta of 1.2,
then it has 20% more volatility than the overall market and moves generally in the same
direction (see the previous section on beta). The Treynor ratio is

		<h3>Other Performance Measurements</h3>
		<p>
			There are numerous variations on performance measures of varying degrees of usefulness. Most often the simplest ones are the best. The value of any measurement is to
rank one trading system or fund above another in terms of risk and reward; that is, to
help make the decision that one is better. The developers of each performance measure
believe that each of others is fl awed, yet the most popular ratios will usually rank the
candidate programs in similar order.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most common performance measure after the information ratio is simply the
maximum drawdown relative the investment size. The maximum drawdown should always be measured as a percentage from a highest NAV to the lowest subsequent NAV.
The maximum drawdown is important because, in a long performance record, a single,
large drawdown can be lost in the standard deviation when there are an overwhelming
number of “normal” drawdowns. A statistician might be satisfi ed saying that there is a
very, very small chance of that large drawdown occurring again, but an investor might
want to know that it did happen and understand why it happened. One measure that
accounts for this is the Calmar ratio

		</p>
		<p>
			Another measure that tries to focus on the drawdowns is the Sortino ratio. It uses downside volatility as the risk, which is the lower partial moment of degree 2, but can also be
substituted with the standard deviation of those days in which the NAV was lower than
the previous high NAV (see the section on semivariance).

			These performance measures will be used throughout the book when comparing different systems. They will be discussed further, along with other performance measures,
in Chapter 21, System Testing.
