		<h2>Probability</h2>
		<code>
			Calculation must measure the incalculable.
			—Dixon G. Watts
		</code>
		<p>
			Change is a term that causes great anxiety. However, the effects and likelihood of a
chance occurrence can only be measured—not predicted. The area of study that deals
with uncertainty is probability. Everyone uses probability in daily thinking and actions.
When you tell someone that you will “be there in 30 minutes,” you are assuming:
<ul>
	<li>Your car will start.</li>
	<li>You will not have a breakdown</li>
	<li>You will have no unnecessary delays.</li>
	<li>You will drive at a predictable speed.</li>
	<li>You will have the normal number of green lights.</li>
</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			All these circumstances are extremely probabilistic, and yet everyone makes the
same assumptions. Actually, the 30-minute arrival is intended only as an estimate of the
average time it should take for the trip. If the arrival time were critical, you would extend
your estimate to 40 or 45 minutes to account for unexpected events. In statistics, this is
called increasing the confi dence interval. You would not raise the time to two hours because the likelihood of such a delay would be too remote. Estimates imply an allowable
variation, all of which is considered normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Probability is the measuring of the uncertainty surrounding an average value. Probabilities are measured in percent of likelihood. For example, if M numbers from a total
of N are expected to fall within a specifi c range, the probability P of any one number
satisfying the criteria is

			When making a trade, or forecasting prices, we can only talk in terms of probabilities or
ranges. We expect prices to rise 30 to 40 points, or we have a 65% chance of a $400 profi t
from a trade. Nothing is certain, but a high probability of success is very attractive.
		</p>
		<h3>Laws of Probability</h3>
		<p>
			Two basic principles of probability are easily explained by using examples with playing
cards. In a deck of 52 cards, there are 4 suits of 13 cards each. The probability of drawing
a specifi c card on any one turn is ½2. Similarly, the chances of drawing a particular suit or
card number are ¼ and ½3, respectively. The probability of any one of these three possibilities occurring is the sum of their individual probabilities. This is known as the
law of addition. The probability of success in choosing a numbered card, suit, or specifi c
card (that is, either a 10, or a spade, or the queen of hearts) is
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/59.png" alt="" width="100%">

		</p>
		<p>
			The other basic principle, the law of multiplication, states that the probability of two
occurrences happening simultaneously or in succession is equal to the product of their
separate probabilities. The likelihood of drawing a 3 and a club from the same deck in
two consecutive turns (replacing the card after each draw) or of drawing the same cards
from two decks simultaneously is

<h3>Joint and Marginal Probability</h3>
<p>
	Price movement is not as clearly defi ned as a deck of cards. There is often a relationship between successive events. For example, over two consecutive days, prices must
have one of the following sequences or joint events: (up, up), (down, down), (up, down),
(down, up), with the joint probabilities of 0.40, 0.10, 0.35, and 0.15, respectively. In this
example, there is the greatest expectation that prices will rise. The marginal probability of a price rise on the fi rst day is shown in Table 2.4, which concludes that there is
a 75% chance of higher prices on the fi rst day and a 55% chance of higher prices on the
second day.
</p>
<h3>Contingent Probability</h3>
<p>
	What is the probability of an outcome “conditioned” on the result of a prior event? In the
example of joint probability, this might be the chance of a price increase on the second
day when prices declined on the fi rst day. The notation for this situation (the probability
of A conditioned on B) is
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/61.png" alt="" width="100%">
The probability of either a price increase on Day 1 or a price increase on Day 2 is
</p>
<p>
	 P(either) = P(up Day1) +  P(up Day 2) − P(up Day1 and up Day 2) <br>
	 = 0.75 + 0.55 − 0.40 <br>
	 = 0.90
	 <img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/62.png" alt="" width="100%">
</p>
<h3>Markov Chains</h3>
<p>
	If we believe that today’s price movement is based in some part on what happened yesterday, we have a situation called conditional probability. This can be expressed as a
Markov process, or Markov chain. The results, or outcomes, of a Markov chain express
the probability of a state or condition occurring. For example, the possibility of a clear,
cloudy, or rainy day tomorrow can be related to today’s weather.
</p>
<p>
	The different combinations of dependent possibilities are given by a transition matrix. In our weather prediction example, a clear day has a 70% chance of being followed
by another clear day, a 25% chance of a cloudy day, and only a 5% chance of rain. In
Table 2.5, each possibility today is shown on the left, and its probability of changing
tomorrow is indicated across the top. Each row totals 100% and accounts for all weather combinations. The relationship between these events can be shown as a continuous
 network (see Figure 2.11).
</p>
<p>
	The Markov process can reduce intricate relationships to a simpler form. First,
 consider a two-state process. Using the markets as an example, what is the probability of
an up or down day following an up day, or following a down day? If there is a 70% chance
of a higher day following a higher day (which we can say is an uptrend) and a 55% chance
of a higher day following a lower day, what is the probability of any day within an uptrend
being up?
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/63.png" alt="" width="100%">
Start with either an up or down day, and then calculate the probability of the next day
being up or down. This is done easily by simply counting the number of cases, given in
Table 2.6a, then dividing to get the percentages, as shown in Table 2.6b.

</p>
<p>
	Because the fi rst day may be designated as up or down, it is an exception to the
general rule and therefore is given the weight of 50%. The probability of the second day
being up or down is the sum of the joint probabilities
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/64.png" alt="" width="100%">
The probability of the second day being up is 62.5%. Continuing in the same manner, use
the probability of an up day as 0.625, the down as 0.375, and calculate the third day,
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/65.png" alt="" width="100%">
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/66.png" alt="" width="100%">
giving the probability of any day being up within an uptrend as
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/67.png" alt="" width="100%">
We can fi nd the chance of an up or down day if the 5-day trend is up simply by substituting the direction of the 5-day trend (or n-day trend) for the previous day’s direction
in the example just given.
</p>
<p>
	Predicting the weather is a more involved case of multiple situations converging and
may be very representative of the way prices react to past prices. By approaching the
problem in the same manner as the two-state process, a 1
3 probability is assigned to each
situation for the fi rst day; the second day’s probability is
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/68.png" alt="" width="100%">

where each i + 1 element can be set equal to the corresponding ith value. There are then
three equations in three unknowns, which can be solved directly or by matrix multiplication, as shown in Appendix 2, “Solution to Weather Probabilities Expressed as a Markov
Chain.”3 Otherwise, it will be necessary to use the additional relationship
</p>
<p>
	The results are <br>
	P(clear) = 0.400 <br>
	P(cloudy) = 0.425 <br>
	P(rainy) = 0.175
</p>
<h3>Bayes’ Theorem</h3>
<p>
	Although historic generalization exists concerning the outcome of an event, a specific
current market situation may alter the probabilities. Bayes’ theorem combines the original probability estimates with the added-event probability (the reliability of the new
information) to get a posterior or revised probability:
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/69.png" alt="" width="100%">

Assume that the price changes P(up) and P(down) are both original probabilities, and
an added-event probability, such as an unemployment report, trade balance, crop report,
inventory stocks, or Federal Reserve interest rate announcement is expected to have
an overriding effect on tomorrow’s movement. Then the new probability P(Up | addedevent) is:
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/70.png" alt="" width="100%">
where up and down refer to the original historic probabilities, and P(A and B) is a joint
probability.
</p>
<p>
	Bayes’ theorem finds the conditional probability even if the joint and marginal probabilities are not known. The new probability P(up | added-event) is:
