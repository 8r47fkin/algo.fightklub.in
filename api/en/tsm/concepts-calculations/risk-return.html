		<h2>Standardizing Risk and Return</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare one trading method with another, it is necessary to standardize both
the tests and the measurements used for evaluation. If one system has total returns of
50% and the other 250%, we cannot decide which is best unless we know the duration of
the test and the volatility of the returns, or risk. If the 50% return was over 1 year and the
250% return over 10 years, then the fi rst one is best. Similarly, if the fi rst return had an
annualized risk of 10% and the second a risk of 50%, then both would be equivalent. The
return relative to the risk is crucial to performance as will be discussed in Chapter 21,
System Testing. For now it is only important that returns and risk be annualized or standardized to make comparisons valid.
		</p>
		<h3>Calculating Returns</h3>
		<p>
			The calculations for both 1-period returns and annualized returns will be an essential
part of all performance evaluations. In its simplest form, the 1-period rate of return, R,
or the holding period rate of return is often given as
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/39.png" alt="" width="100%">
For the stock market, which has continuous prices, this can be written
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/40.png" alt="" width="100%">
where p0 is the initial price and p1 is the price after one period has elapsed. The securities
industry often prefers a different calculation
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/41.png" alt="" width="100%">
Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Neither one is the “correct” calculation. Note that in some software, the function log is actually the natural log, and
log10 is the log base 10. It is best to always check the defi nitions. In order to distinguish
the two calculations, the fi rst method will be called the standard method and the second
the ln method.

		</p>
		<p>
			In the following spreadsheet example, shown in Table 2.3 over 22 days, the standard
returns are in column D and the ln returns in column E. The differences seem small,
but the averages are 0.00350 and 0.00339. The standard returns are better by 3.3% over
only one trading month. At this rate, the standard method would have yielded returns
that were nearly 40% higher after one year. The net asset value (NAV), used extensively
throughout this book, compounds the periodic returns, and most often has a starting
value, NAV0 = 100.

		</p>
		<h3>Annualizing Returns</h3>
		<p>
			In most cases, it is best to standardize the returns by annualizing. This is particularly
helpful when comparing two sets of test results, where each covers a different time
period. When annualizing, it is important to know that
			<ul>
				<li>Government instruments use a 360-day rate (based on 90- day quarters).</li>
				<li>A 365-day rate is common for most other data that can change daily</li>
				<li>Trading returns are best with 252 days, which is the typical number of days in a
					trading year for the United States (262 days for Europe).</li>
			</ul>
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/43.png" alt="" width="100%">
The following formulas use 252 days, which will be the standard throughout this
book except for certain interest rate calculations; however, 365 or 360 may be substituted, or even 260 for trading days in other parts of the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			The annualized rate of return (AROR) on a simple-interest basis for an investment
over n days is
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/44.png" alt="" width="100%">

where E0 is the starting equity or account balance, En is the equity at the end of the nth
period, and 252/n are the years expressed as a decimal. When the 1-period returns are calculated using the standard method, then the annualized compounded rate of return is
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that AROR or R (capital) refers to the annualized rate of return while r is the daily
or 1-period return. Also, the form of the results is different for the two calculations. An increase of 25% for the simple return will show as 0.25 while the same increase using the
compounded returns will be 1.25.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the 1-period returns use the ln method, then the annualized rate of return is the
sum of the returns divided by the number of years
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/45.png" alt="" width="100%">

An example of this can be found in column F, the row labeled AROR, in the previous
spreadsheet. Note that the annualized returns using the ln method are much lower than
those using division and compounding. The compounded method will be used throughout this book.
		</p>
		<h3>Probability of Returns</h3>
		<p>
			The use of the standard deviation and compounded rate of return are combined to
fi nd the probability of a return objective. In the following calculation,
2 the arithmetic
mean of continuous returns is ln(1 + Rg), and it is assumed that the returns are normally
distributed. 
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/46.png" alt="" width="100%">

		</p>
		<h3>Risk and Volatility</h3>
		<p>
			While we would always like to think about returns, it is even more important to be able to
assess risk. With that in mind, there are two extreme risks. The fi rst is event risk, which
takes the form of an unpredictable price shock. The worst of these is catastrophic risk,
which will cause fatal losses or ruin. The second risk is self-induced by overleverage, or
gearing up your portfolio, until a sequence of bad trades causes ruin. The risk of price
shocks and leverage will both be discussed in detail later in other chapters.
		</p>
		<p>
			The standard risk measurement is useful for comparing the performance of two
systems. It is commonly applied to the returns of a single stock or an entire portfolio 
compared to a benchmark, such as the returns of the S&P 500 or a bond fund. The
most common estimate of risk is the standard deviation, σ, of returns, r, shown earlier
in this chapter. For most discussions of risk, the standard deviation will also be called
volatility. When we refer to the target volatility of a portfolio, we mean the percentage
of risk represented by 1 standard deviation of the returns, annualized. For example, in
the previous spreadsheet, columns D and E show the daily returns. The standard deviations of those returns are shown in the same columns in the row “Std Dev” as 0.01512
and 0.01495. Looking only at column D, 1 standard deviation of 0.01502 means that
there is a 68% chance of a daily profi t or loss less than 1.502%. However, target volatility always refers to annualized risk, and to change a daily return to an annualized one
we simply multiply by sqrt 252. Then the daily standard deviation of returns of 1.512% becomes an annualized volatility of 23.8%, also shown at the bottom of the spreadsheet
example. Because we only care about the downside risk, there is a 16% chance that we
could lose 23.8% in one year. The greater the standard deviation of returns, the greater
the risk.
		</p>
		<h3>Beta</h3>
		<p>
			Beta (β) is commonly used in the securities industry to express the relationship of a
single market to an index or portfolio. If beta is zero then there is no relationship; if it is
positive then the single series tends to move with the index, both above and below. As
beta gets larger the volatility of the single market tends to be increasingly greater than
the index. Specifically,
<ul>
	<li>0 < β < 1, the volatility of the single market is less than the index</li>
	<li>β = 1, the volatility of the single market is the same as the index</li>
	<li>β > 1, the volatility of the single market is greater than the index</li>
</ul>
A negative beta is similar to a negative correlation, where the moves of the market
are generally opposite to the index.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beta is found by calculating the linear regression of the single market with the index.
It is the slope of the single market divided by the slope of the index. Alpha, the added
value, is the y-intercept of the solution. The values can be found using Excel, and are
discussed in detail in Chapter 6. A general formula for beta is <br>
Beta(A) = cov(returns A, returns B)/var(returns B) <br>
where A is the single market and B is a portfolio or index.
		</p>
		<h3>Adjusting to the Target Volatility</h3>
		<p>
			If we have a target volatility of 12%, that is, we are willing to accept a 16% chance of losing
12% in one year, but the actual returns show an annualized volatility of 23.8% based on an
investment of $100,000, then to correct to a 12% target we simply increase the investment
by 23.8/12.0, or a factor of 1.98 to $198,000, while holding the same position size. This is
essentially deleveraging your positions by trading a smaller percentage of your account 
value. Alternatively, we can reduce the position size by dividing by 1.98 and keeping the
investment the same.
		</p>
		<p>
			All results in this book will be shown at the target volatility of 12% unless otherwise
stated. This is considered a modest risk level, which can be as high as 18% for some
hedge funds. It will allow you to compare various systems and test results and see them
at a level of risk that is most likely to represent targeted trading results.
		</p>
		<h3>Annualizing Daily and Monthly Returns</h3>
		<p>
			The previous examples used daily data and an annualization factor of sqrt 252. For monthly
data, which is most common in published performance tables, we would take the monthly
returns and multiply by sqrt12. In general, annualizing can be done by multiplying the data
by the square root of the number of data items in a year. Then we use 252 for daily data,
12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly, and so on.
		</p>
		<h3>Monthly Data Always Appears Less Volatile</h3>
		<p>
			Although monthly performance results are common in fi nancial disclosure documents,
this convention works to the advantage of the person publishing the performance. It
is unlikely that the highest or lowest daily net asset value (NAV) will occur on the last
day of the month, so the extremes will rarely be seen, and the performance statistics
will appear smoother than when using daily returns. Those responsible for due diligence
before investing in a new product will often require daily return data in order to avoid
overlooking a large drawdown that occurred mid-month.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the S&P index as an example, the annualized volatility of the daily returns
from 1990 through 2010 was 18.6%, but based on monthly returns it was only 15.3%. The
risk based on monthly returns is 17.7% lower, but the annualized rate of return would be
the same because it only uses the beginning and ending values.
		</p>
		<h3>Downside Risk</h3>
		<p>
			Because the standard deviation is symmetric, a series of jumps in profi ts will be interpreted as larger risk. Some analysts believe that it is more accurate to measure the risk as
limited to only the downside returns or drawdowns. The use of only losses is called lower
partial moments, where lower refers to the downside risk, and partial means where only
one side of the return distribution is used. The easiest way to see this is semivariance,
which measures the dispersion that falls below the mean, R, or some target value,
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/48.png" alt="" width="100%">
However, the most common calculation for system performance is to take the daily
drawdowns, that is, the net loss on each day that the total equity is below the peak
equity. For example, if the system returns had produced an equity of $25,000 on day
t, followed by a daily loss of $500, and another loss of $250, then we would have two
values as input 500/25000 and 750/25000, or 0.02 and 0.03. Only those net returns below 
the most recent peaks are used in the semivariance calculation. Alternatively, you could
just take the standard deviation of these daily drawdowns to fi nd the probable size of
the drawdowns.
		</p>
		<p>
			One concern about using only the drawdowns to predict other drawdowns is that
it limits the number of cases and discards the likelihood that higher-than-normal profi ts
can be related to higher overall risk. In situations where there are limited amounts of test
data, using both the gains and losses will give more robust results. When there is a large
amount of data, the use of drawdowns can be a very good measurement.

Testing, and also in Chapter 23 under the headings “Measuring Return and Risk” and
“Ulcer Index.”
