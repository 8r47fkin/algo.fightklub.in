		<h2>On Average</h2>
		<p>
			In working with numbers, it is often necessary to use representative values. The range of
values or the average may be substituted to change a single price into a general characteristic in order to solve a problem. The average (arithmetic mean) of many values can
be a preferable substitute for any one value. For example, the average retail price of one
pound of coffee in the Northeast is more meaningful to a cost-of-living calculation than
the price at any one store. However, not all data can be combined or averaged and still
have meaning. The average of all prices taken on the same day would not say anything
about an individual market that was part of the average. Averaging the prices of unrelated
items, such as a box of breakfast cereal, the hourly cost of automobile repair, and the
price of the German DAX index would produce a number of questionable value. The average of a group of numbers must have some useful meaning.
		</p>
		<p>
			The average can be misleading in other ways. Consider coffee, which rose from $0.40
to $2.00 per pound in one year. The average price of this product may appear to be $1.20;
however, this would not account for the time that coffee was sold at various price levels.
Table 2.1 divides the coffee price into four equal intervals, then shows that the time spent
at these levels was uniformly opposite to the price rise. That is, prices remained at lower
levels longer and at higher levels for shorter time periods, which is very normal price
behavior
		</p>
		<p>
			When the time spent at each price level is included, it can be seen that the average
price should be lower than $1.20. One way to calculate this, knowing the specifi c number
of days in each interval, is by using a weighted average of the price

	This result can vary based on the number of time intervals used; however, it gives a better idea of the correct average price. There are two other averages for which time is an important element—the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.
	<h3>Geometric Mean</h3>
	<p>
		The geometric mean represents a growth function in which a price change from 50 to 100
is as important as a change from 100 to 200. If there are n prices, a1, a2, a3, . . . , an, then
the geometric mean is the nth root of the product of the prices
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/5.png" alt="" width="100%">
The two solutions are equivalent. The term ln is the natural log, or log base e. (Note that
there is some software where the function log actually is ln.) Using the price levels in
Table 2.1,
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/6.png" alt="" width="100%">
While the arithmetic mean, which is time-weighted, gave the value of 105.71, the geometric
mean shows the average as 104.19.
	</p>
	The geometric mean has advantages in application to economics and prices. A classic example compares a tenfold rise in price from 100 to 1000 to a fall to one tenth from 100 to 10. An arithmetic mean of the two values 10 and 1000 is 505, while the geometric
	mean gives
	<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/7.png" alt="" width="80%">
	and shows the relative distribution of prices as a function of comparable growth. Due to
this property, the geometric mean is the best choice when averaging ratios that can be
either fractions or percentages.
	<h3>Quadratic Mean</h3>
	<p>
		The quadratic mean is most often used for estimation of error. It is calculated as:
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/8.png" alt="" width="60%">

		The quadratic mean is the square root of the mean of the square of the items (rootmean-square). It is most well known as the basis for the standard deviation. This will
be discussed later in this chapter in the section “Moments of the Distribution: Variance,
Skewness, and Kurtosis.”
	</p>
	<h3>Harmonic Mean</h3>
	<p>
		The harmonic mean is another time-weighted average, but not biased toward higher
or lower values as in the geometric mean. A simple example is to consider the average
speed of a car that travels 4 miles at 20 mph, then 4 miles at 30 mph. An arithmetic mean
would give 25 mph, without considering that 12 minutes were spent at 20 mph and 8 minutes at 30 mph. The weighted average would give
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/9.png" alt="" width="100%">
This allows the solution pattern to be seen. For the 20 and 30 mph rates of speed, the
solution is
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/10.png" alt="" width="100%">


which is the same answer as the weighted average. Considering the original set of numbers again, the basic form of harmonic mean can be applied:
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/11.png" alt="" width="100%">
We might apply the harmonic mean to price swings, where the fi rst swing moved 20 points
over 12 days and the second swing moved 30 points over 8 days.
