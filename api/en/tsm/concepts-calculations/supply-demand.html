		<h2>Supply and Demand</h2>
		<p>
			Price is the balancing point of supply and demand. In order to estimate the future price
			of any product or explain its historic patterns, it will be necessary to relate the factors of
			supply and demand and then adjust for infl ation, technological improvement, and other
			indicators common to econometric analysis. The following sections briefly describe
			these factors.
		</p>
		<h3>Demand</h3>
		<p>
			The demand for a product declines as price increases. The rate of decline is always dependent on the need for the product and its available substitutes at different price levels.
			In Figure 2.12a, D represents normal demand for a product over some fi xed period. As
			prices rise, demand declines fairly rapidly. D′ represents increased demand, resulting in
			higher prices at all levels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Figure 2.12b represents the actual demand relationship for potatoes from 1929 to
			1939. Although this example is the same as the theoretical relationship in Figure 2.12a, in
			most cases the demand relationship is not a straight line. Production costs and minimum
			demand prevent the curve from going to zero; instead, it approaches a minimum price
			level. This can be seen previously in the frequency distribution for wheat, Figure 2.3,
			where the left side of the distribution falls (lower price) off sharply. On the higher end
			of the scale, there is a lag in the response to increased prices and a consumer reluctance
			to reduce purchasing even at higher prices (called “inelastic demand”). Coffee is wellknown for having inelastic demand—most coffee drinkers will pay the market price rather than consume less. Figure 2.12c shows a more representative demand curve, including
			extremes, where 100 represents the cost of production for a producer. The demand curve,

		<p>
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/73.png" alt="" width="100%">
therefore, shows the rate at which a change in quantity demanded brings about a change
in price. Note that, although a producer may lose money below 100, lack of demand and
the need for income can force sales at a loss.
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/74.png" alt="" width="100%">
</p>
<h3>Elasticity of Demand</h3>
<p>
	Elasticity is the key factor in expressing the relationship between price and demand and
defines the shape of the curve. It is the relative change in demand as price increases:
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/75.png" alt="" width="100%">
A market that always consumes the same amount of a product, regardless of price,
is called inelastic; as price rises, the demand remains the same, and ED is negatively very
small. An elastic market is just the opposite. As demand increases, price remains the
same and ED is negatively very large. Figure 2.13 shows the demand curve for various
levels of demand elasticity.
</p>
<p>
	If supply increases for a product that has existed in short supply for many years, consumer purchasing habits will require time to adjust. The demand elasticity will gradually
shift from relatively inelastic (Figure 2.13b) to relatively elastic (Figure 2.13a).
</p>
<h3>Supply</h3>
<p>
	The supply side of the economic equation is the normal counterpart of demand.
 Figure 2.14a shows that, as price increases, the supplier will respond by offering greater
amounts of the product. Figure 2.14b demonstrates the supply at price extremes. At low
levels, below production costs, there is a nominal supply by those producers who must
maintain operations due to high fi xed costs and diffi culty restarting after a shutdown (as
in mining). At high price levels, supply is erratic. There may be insuffi cient supply in the
short term, followed by the appearance of new supplies or substitutes, as in the case of
a location shortage. When there is a shortage of orange juice, South American countries
are willing to fi ll the demand; when there is an oil disruption, other OPEC nations will
 increase production. In most cases, however, it is reduced demand that brings price down.
</p>
<h3>Elasticity of Supply</h3>
<p>
	The elasticity of supply ES is the relationship between the change in supply and the
change in price:
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/76.png" alt="" width="100%">
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/77.png" alt="" width="100%">
The elasticity of supply, the counterpart of demand elasticity, is a positive number
because price and quantity move in the same direction at the same time.
</p>
<h3>Equilibrium</h3>
<p>
	The demand for a product and the supply of that product cross at a point of equilibrium.
The current price of any product, or any security, represents the point of equilibrium for
that product at that moment in time. This is the basis for the technical assessment that
the price, at any moment in time, represents the netting of all fundamental information.
Figure 2.15 shows a constant demand line D and a shifting supply, increasing to the right
from S to S′.
</p>
<p>
	The demand line D and the original supply line S meet at the equilibrium price P;
after the increase in supply, the supply line shifts to S′. The point of equilibrium P′ represents a lower price, the consequence of larger supply with unchanged demand. Because
supply and demand each have varying elasticities and are best represented by curves, the
point of equilibrium can shift in any direction in a market with changing factors.
</p>
<p>
	Equilibrium will be an important concept in developing trading strategies. Although
the supply and demand balance may not be calculated, in practical terms equilibrium is
a balance between buyers and sellers, a price level at which everyone is willing to trade,
although not always happy to do so at that price. Equilibrium is associated with lower
volatility and often lower volume because the urgency to buy or sell has been removed.
Imbalance in the supply-demand-price relationship causes volatility. Readers interested
in a practical representation of equilibrium, or price-value relationships, should study
“Price Distribution Systems” in Steidlmayer’s Market Profile, Chapter 18.

</p>
<h3>Cobweb Charts</h3>
<p>
	The point at which the supply and demand lines cross is easily translated into a place on
a price chart where the direction is sideways. The amount of price volatility during this
sideways period (called noise) depends upon the price level, market participation, and
various undertones of instability caused by other factors. Very little is discussed about
how price patterns refl ect the shift in sentiment between the supply and demand lines,
yet there is a clear representation of this action using cobweb charts.
</p>
<p>
	Figure 2.16a shows a static (symmetric) supply-demand chart with dotted lines representing the “cobweb.” A shift in the perceived importance of supply and demand factors can cause prices to refl ect the pattern shown by the direction of the arrows on the
cobweb, producing the sideways market represented by Figure 2.16b. If the cobweb were
closer to the intersection of the supply and demand lines, the volatility of the sideways
price pattern would be lower; if the cobweb were further away from the intersection, the
pattern would be more volatile.
</p>
<p>
	Most supply/demand relationships are not static and can be represented by lines that
cross at oblique angles. In Figure 2.17a, the cobweb is shown to begin near the intersection and move outwards, each shift forming a different length strand of the web, moving
away from equilibrium. Figure 2.17b shows that the corresponding price pattern is one
that shifts from equilibrium to increasing volatility. A reversal in the arrows on the cobweb would show decreasing volatility moving toward equilibrium.

</p>
<h3>Building a Model</h3>
<p>
	A model can be created to explain or forecast price changes. Most models explain rather
than forecast. Explanatory models analyze sets of data at concurrent times: that is, they
look for relationships between multiple factors and their effect on price at the same
moment in time. They can also look for causal, or lagged relationships, where prices
respond to other factors after one or more days. It is possible to use the explanatory
model to determine the normal price at a particular moment. Although not considered 
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/80.png" alt="" width="100%">
forecasting, any variation in the actual market price from the normal or expected price
could present a trading opportunity.
</p>
<p>
	Methods of selecting the best forecasting model can affect its credibility. An analytic
approach selects the factors and specifi es the relationships in advance. Tests are then
performed on the data to verify the premise. Many models, though, are refi ned by fi tting the data, using regression analysis or some mass testing process, which applies a
broad selection of variables and weighting factors to fi nd the best fi t. These models, created with perfect hindsight, are far less likely to be successful at forecasting future price
levels. Even an analytic approach that is subsequently fi ne-tuned could be in danger of
losing its forecasting ability.
</p>
<p>
	The factors that comprise a model can be both numerous and diffi cult to obtain.
Figure 2.18 shows the interrelationship between factors in the cocoa industry. Although
this chart is comprehensive in its intramarket relationships, it does not emphasize the
global infl uences that have become a major part of price movement since the mid-1970s.
The change in value of the U.S. dollar and the volatility of interest rates have had far
greater infl uence on price than some of the “normal” fundamental factors for many commodities. Companies with high debt may fi nd the price fl uctuations in their stock are
larger due to interest rate changes than increases or decreases in revenues.
</p>
<p>
	Models that explain price movements must be constructed from the primary factors
of supply and demand. A simple example for estimating the price of fall potatoes is <br>
P/PPI = a + bS + cD <br>
where, <br>
P = the average price of fall potatoes received by farmers <br>
PPI = the Producer Price Index <br>
S = the apparent domestic free supply (production less exports and diversions) <br>
D = the estimated deliverable supply <br>
a, b, and c = constants determined by regression analysis <br>

</p>
<p>
	This model implies that consumption must be constant (i.e., inelastic demand); demand factors are only implicitly included in the estimated deliverable supply. Exports
and diversion represent a small part of the total production. The use of the PPI gives the
results in relative terms based on whether the index was used as an infl ator or defl ator
of price.
</p>
<p>
	A general model, presented by Weymar,6 may be written as three behavior-based
equations and one identity: <br>
Consumption <br>
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/81.png" alt="" width="100%">
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/82.png" alt="" width="100%">
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/83.png" alt="" width="100%">
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/84.png" alt="" width="100%">

</p>
<p>
	The fi rst two equations show that both demand and supply depend on current and/
or lagged prices, the traditional macroeconomic theory; production and consumption
are therefore dependent on past prices. The third equation, inventory level, is simply
the total of previous inventories, plus new production, less current consumption. The
last equation, supply of storage, demonstrates that people are willing to carry larger
inventories if they expect prices to increase substantially. The inventory function itself, 
the third equation, is composed of two separate relationships: manufacturers’
inventories and speculators’ inventories. Each reacts differently to expected price
change.
</p>
<h3>Changing Factors</h3>
<p>
	Although the PPI was always considered the component of infl ation and used in forecasting prices, the value of the U.S. dollar has not been an input. Currency values have always
fluctuated but have taken on more signifi cance following the dropping of the gold standard by most countries. The value of a currency is based on the health of the economy as
measured by production output and infl ation, among other factors.
</p>
<p>
	Wheat is a good example to show the impact of these changes. As an export market
for the United States, the price of wheat refl ects the world value, that is, what other countries are willing to pay. Wheat is fungible, in other words, a country in need will buy from
any source with the lowest price, and that keeps all prices competitive.
</p>
<p>
	Rather than the complex analysis of factors shown in the previous section on cocoa,
we will only look at the impact of infl ation and currency changes on the price of wheat.
Figure 2.19 shows the monthly price of cash wheat, along with the PPI and the U.S. dollar index (DX). The dollar index shows the relative value of the U.S. dollar; therefore, a
decline in DX indicates a weaker U.S. dollar. Both the PPI and DX have been indexed to
begin 1985 with the value of 100.
</p>
<p>
	In Figure 2.19 the PPI nearly doubles from 1.0 to 1.8 while the U.S. dollar halves to
0.51. At the same time wheat prices rise 69% from 100 to 169 (the cash price from $3.56
to $7.13). If we are only concerned with the big picture, the macro factors rather than
the seaonality of price, then the rise in wheat prices over this 25-year interval can be
completely explained by either the PPI or the DX. In fact, they are clearly related because
infl ation (PPI) has a negative effect on the currency value.
</p>
<p>
	By dividing the indexed price of wheat by the PPI or multiplying wheat by the DX
value, Figure 2.20 shows that the long-term price of wheat is unchanged. By observation,
we can conclude that the rise in wheat prices is attributed to infl ation, the decline in the
value of the U.S. dollar, or both.
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/85.png" alt="" width="100%">
If we then want to look at the effect of seasonality, or supply and demand, factors
that cause wheat prices to lose 75% of its value or gain 100%, we need to remove the
 effects of infl ation fi rst. For trading, this means selling DX in the same dollar value as
buying wheat so that, if the price of wheat rises due to the U.S. dollar falling, the change
in value of the hedge position is close to zero.
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/86.png" alt="" width="100%">
</p>
<p>
	In the case of wheat, it is clear that the price is affected by infl ation. It may be that the
success of most wheat trading strategies depends on the trend of infl ation, rather than
the underlying wheat factors. However, if the intent is to profi t from seasonal moves,
then a rally in May when a good crop is being harvested may be obscured by a rise in the
U.S. dollar. Without hedging the potential effects of the dollar you leave the results of the
strategy to chance. This will be discussed with examples in Chapter 10, Seasonality and
Calendar Patterns.
</p>
<h3>Economic Reports</h3>
<p>
	Economic reports are released nearly every day. Based on the economic condition of
the nation, investor focus shifts from one report to another. Since 2008 the focus has
been on the employment reports, the ultimate solution to recovery; GDP, a measure
of that recovery; and of less importance housing, consumer confidence, and various
manufacturing data. The Leading Economic Index (LEI), released by the Conference
Board each month, tries to anticipate the direction of the economy about six months
ahead based on
<ul>
	<li>Average weekly hours, manufacturing</li>
	<li>Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance</li>
	<li>Manufacturers’ new orders, consumer goods and materials</li>
	<li>Index of supplier deliveries—vendor performance</li>
	<li>Manufacturers’ new orders, nondefense capital goods</li>
	<li>Building permits, new private housing units</li>
	<li>Stock prices, 500 common stocks</li>
	<li>Money supply, M2</li>
	<li>Interest rate spread, 10-year Treasury bonds less federal funds</li>
	<li>Index of consumer expectations</li>
</ul>
Most of these seem reasonable, but the weighting of them is not clear. It has been said
that the direction of the stock market plays a relatively large part in the index.
</p>
<p>
	Can these and other indicators be used for trading? Are they timely, or are the expectations of their impact in the market even before the reports are released? With many
reports, the market anticipates the numbers. If unemployment was expected to increase,
then the stock market tends to sell off ahead of the report, or if economists anticipate
the Fed lowering rates, then the yield curve will adjust to that expectation ahead of the
announcement. Therefore, it is the difference between the expectation and the actual
report that moves the market, and only secondarily is it the actual numbers released. For
example, if the GDP was expected to rise from 3.5% to 4.0% and the actual number came
in at 3.6% the market would sell off. But then it would rally again because 3.6% is still a
good number indicating growth. While large, unexpected changes move the market, the
cumulative effect of small changes could also be significant.
</p>
<p>
	Ruggiero has quantifi ed the signifi cance of some of these indicators, concentrating
on predicting the direction of yields, which is key to much of the fi nancial market price
moves.
