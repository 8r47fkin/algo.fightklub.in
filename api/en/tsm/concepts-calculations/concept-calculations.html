		<h2>Basic Concepts and Calculations</h2>
		<p>
			<code>
				Economics is not an exact science: it consists merely of Laws of
				Probability. The most prudent investor, therefore, is one who pursues
				only a general course of action which is “normally” right and who
				avoids acts and policies which are “normally” wrong.

				—L . L . B. Angas

			<p>
				New technology gives us a sense of security. There is data from everywhere in
the world at our fingertips, programs that perform sophisticated calculations
 instantly, and access to anyone at any time.
			</p>
			<p>
				As Isaac Asimov foretold, there will come a time when we will no longer know
how to do the calculation for long division because miniature, voice-activated computers will be everywhere. We might not even need to be able to add; it will all be done
for us. We will just assume that the answer is correct, because computers don’t make
mistakes.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a small way this is happening now. Not everyone checks their spreadsheet calculations by hand to be certain they are correct before going further. Nor does everyone print
the intermediate results of computer calculations to verify their accuracy. Computers
don’t make mistakes, but people do.
			</p>
			<p>
				With computer software and trading platforms making price analysis easier and
more sophisticated, we no longer think of the steps involved in a moving average or linear regression. A few years ago, we looked at the correlation between investments only
when absolutely necessary because they were too complicated and time-consuming to
calculate. It would even be diffi cult to know if you had made a mistake without having
someone else repeat the same calculations. Now we face a different problem: If the computer does it all, we lose our understanding of why a moving average trendline differs
from a linear regression. Without looking at the data, we don’t see an erroneous outlier
or that the stock wasn’t adjusted for splits. By not reviewing each hypothetical trade, we
miss seeing that the slippage can turn a profi t into a loss
			</p>
			<p>
				To avoid losing the edge needed to create a profi table trading strategy, the basic
tools of the trade are explained in this chapter. Those of you already familiar with these
 methods may skip over it; others need to be confident that they can perform these
 calculations manually even while they use a spreadsheet.
			</p>
			<h3>Helpful Software</h3>
			<p>
				In Excel, many of the functions, such as the standard deviation, are readily accessible
at any time. The more advanced statistical functions require that you install the Add-Ins,
which also come free with Excel. These include histograms, regression analysis, F-test,
t-test, z-test, Fourier analysis, and various smoothing techniques. To install these add-ins
in Excel 2010, go to File/Options/Add-Ins and select the Analysis Toolpak. You will also
want the Solver Add-in. Once installed, which takes only a few seconds, these functions
can be accessed in the Data menu at the top of the screen. You should fi nd the Data
Analysis and Solver options at the far right on the menu bar.
			</p>
			<p>
				There are other very useful and user-friendly statistical programs, available at a
wide range of sophistication and price. One of the best values is Pro-Stat by Poly
Software (polysoftware.com). The examples in this chapter will use both Excel and
Pro-Stat.
