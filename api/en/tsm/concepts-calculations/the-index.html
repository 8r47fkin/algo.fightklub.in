		<h2>The Index</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of an average is to transform individuality into classifi cation. In doing that,
the data is often smoothed, and useful information is gained. Indexes have attracted
enormous popularity in recent years. Where there was only the Value Line and S&P 500
trading as futures markets in the early 1980s, now there are stock index futures contracts representing the markets of every industrialized country. The creation of trusts,
such as SPDRs (called “Spyders,” the S&P 500), Diamonds (DIA, the Dow Jones Industrials), and Qs (QQQ, the NASDAQ 100) have given stock traders a familiar vehicle to
invest in the broad market rather than pick individual shares. Industrial sectors, such
as pharmaceuticals, health care, and technology, fi rst appeared as mutual funds, then
as ETFs, and now can also be traded as futures. These index markets all have the additional advantage of not being constrained by having to borrow shares in order to sell
short, or by the uptick rule (if it is reinstated) requiring all short sales to be initiated on
an uptick in price.
		</p>
		<p>
			Index markets allow both individual and institutional participants a number of specialized investment strategies. They can buy or sell the broad market, they can switch
from one sector to another (sector rotation), or they can sell an overpriced sector while
buying the broad market index (statistical arbitrage). Institutions fi nd it very desirable,
from the view of both costs and taxes, to temporarily hedge their cash stock portfolio
by selling S&P 500 futures rather than liquidating stock positions. They may also hedge
using options on the S&P futures or SPYs. An index simplifi es the decision-making
process for trading. If an index does not exist, one can be constructed to satisfy most
purposes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The index holds an important role as a benchmark for performance. Most investors
believe that a trading program is only attractive if it has a better return-to-risk ratio than
a portfolio of 60% stocks (as represented by the S&P 500 index), and 40% bonds (the Lehman Brothers Treasury Index). Beating the index is called creating alpha, proving that
you’re smarter than the market.
		</p>
		<h3>Constructing an Index</h3>
		<p>
			An index is standardized way of expressing price movement, normally an accumulation
of percentage changes. Most indexes have a starting value of 100 on a specifi c date. The
selection of the base year is often “convenient” but can be chosen as a period of price
stability. The base year for U.S. productivity and for unemployment is 1982; for consumer
confi dence, 1985; and for the composite of leading indicators, 1987. The CRB Yearbook
shows the Producer Price Index (PPI) from as far back as 1913. For example, the PPI,
which is released monthly, had a value of 186.8 in October 2010 and 185.1 in September
2010, a 0.9184% increase in one month. An index value less than 100 means that the index
has less value than when it started.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each index value is calculated from the previous value as:
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/49.png" alt="" width="100%">
and the 1-period returns are calculated in the same way as shown previously in this
 chapter
		</p>
		<h3>Calculating the Net Asset Value—Indexing Returns</h3>
		<p>
			The last calculations shown in the spreadsheet, Table 2.3, are the net asset value (NAV),
calculated two ways. This is essentially the returns converted to an index, showing
the compounded rate of return based on daily profi t and losses relative to a starting
 investment. In the spreadsheet, this is shown in column F using standard returns and G
using ln returns.
		</p>
		<p>
			The process of calculating NAVs can be done with the following steps:
			<ol>
				<li>Establish the initial investment, in this case $100,000, shown at the top of column C.
					This can be adjusted later based on the target volatility.</li>
					<li>Calculate the cumulative account value by adding the daily profi ts or losses
						( column B) to the previous account value (column C).</li>
						<li>Calculate the daily returns by either (a) dividing today’s profi t or loss by yesterday’s
							account value to get r, or (b) taking the natural log of 1 + r</li>
							<li>If using method (a) then each subsequent NAVt = NAVt−1 × (1 + r), and if using method
								(b) then each NAVt = NAVt−1 + ln(1 + r).</li>
			</ol>
			The final values of the NAV are in the last dated rows. The U.S. government requires
that NAVs be calculated this way, although it doesn’t specify whether returns should
be based on the natural log. This process is also identical to indexing, which turns any
price series into one that refl ects percentage returns.
		</p>
		<h3>Leveraged Long or Short Index Funds</h3>
		<p>
			As index markets have become more popular, fi nancial engineering has created a wide
range of innovative trading vehicles. Mutual funds, such as Rydex and ProFunds, cater
to market timers, a group of money managers that may trade in and out of the funds
each day. These funds track the major index markets closely, but offer unique variations.
There are both long and short funds, and each may be leveraged. When you buy a long
fund that tracks the S&P 500 (called Nova by Rydex), you are simply long the equivalent
of the S&P 500. However, when you buy a short S&P fund, called Ursa, you profi t when
the S&P index price drops. In addition, both Rydex and ProFunds offer leverage of 1.5 or
2.0 on these funds, so that a gain of 1.0% in the S&P 500 translates into a gain of 2.0% in
ProFunds’ UltraBull S&P fund; a drop of 1.0% in the S&P would generate a profi t of 2.0%
in ProFunds’ UltraBear fund. The motivation behind the short funds, or inverse funds,
is to circumvent the U.S. government rule that does not permit short sales in retirement
accounts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The calculation for leveraged long funds is very similar to a simple index; however,
a short fund (where you profi t from a decline in prices) is compounded to the upside, in
the same way as a long fund. The following calculation will create a long and short index
that closely approximates those used by Rydex and ProFunds. In addition, it includes the
calculation of the daily high and low index values. If you intend to create a leveraged S&P
index, start with the cash S&P price. Use the cash index equivalent for each of the mutual
fund indexes that you plan to duplicate.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the following calculations, leverage is the leverage factor of the fund. Initial index
values for both long and short funds are
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/50.png" alt="" width="100%">
Each subsequent index value for long funds is
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/51.png" alt="" width="100%">
For each subsequent value for the short funds invert the middle term:
<img src="/api/en/tsm/concepts-calculations/52.png" alt="" width="100%">
where XC, XH, and XL = the leveraged index closing, high, and low prices <br>
C, H, and L = the underlying close, high, and low prices or index values.

		</p>
		<p>
			If there is no leverage, then substitute the value 1 for leverage in the equations.
		</p>
		<h3>Cross-Market and Weighted Index</h3>
		<p>
			It is very convenient to create an index for two markets that cannot normally be
 compared because they trade in different units. For example, if you wanted to show
the spread between gold and IBM, you could index them both beginning at the same
date. The new indexes would then be in the same units (percent) and would be easy to
compare.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most often, an index combines a number of related markets into a single number.
A simple aggregate index is the ratio of unweighted sums of market prices in a specifi c
year to the same markets in the base year. Most of the popular indexes, such as the New
York Stock Exchange Composite Index, fall into this class. A weighted aggregate index
biases certain markets by weighting them to increase or decrease their effect on the
composite value. The index is then calculated as in the simple aggregate index. When
combining markets into a single index value, the total of all the weights will equal 1 and
all weights are expressed as a percentage.
		</p>
		<h3>U.S. Dollar Index</h3>
		<p>
			A practical example of a weighted index is the U.S. Dollar Index, traded as DX on the
New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) and USDX on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
It is a trade-weighted geometric average of six currencies: the euro, 57.6%; the Japanese
yen, 13.6%; the UK pound, 11.9%; the Canadian dollar, 9.1%; the Swedish krona, 4.2%;
and the Swiss franc, 3.6%. The Dollar Index serves as a valuable economic indicator, but
shows only 13.6% representing Asia. It is not a good substitute for a diversifi ed world
market portfolio.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Dollar Index rises when the U.S. dollar increases in value relative to the other
currencies. In the daily calculation of the Dollar Index, each price change is represented
as a percent. If, for example, the euro rises 50 points from 1.2500 to 1.2550, the change
is 1.2550/1.2500 = .004; this is multiplied by its weighting factor 0.576 and contributes
–0.002304 to the index (a rising euro is a falling dollar).
