		<h2>Charting</h2>
		<p>
			It is very likely that all trading systems began with a price chart, and we come back to
			a chart whenever we want a clear view of where the market is going. Nowhere can a
			picture be more valuable than in price forecasting. Elaborate theories and complex
			formulas may ultimately be successful, but the loss of perspective is easily corrected
			with a simple chart. We should remember the investor who, anxious after a long technical 
			presentation by a research analyst, could only blurt out, “But is it going up or down?”
			Even with the most sophisticated market strategies, the past buy and sell signals should
			be seen on a chart. The appearance of an odd trade can save you a lot of aggravation and
			money.

			Through the mid-1980s technical analysis was considered only as chart interpretation. 
			In the equities industry, that perception is still strong. Most traders begin as chartists, 
			and many return to it or use it even while using other methods. William L. Jiler, a
			great trader and founder of Commodity Research Bureau, wrote:
		</p>
		<code>
			One of the most signifi cant and intriguing concepts derived from intensive chart
			studies by this writer is that of characterization, or habit. Generally speaking,
			charts of the same commodity tend to have similar pattern sequences which may
			be different from those of another commodity. In other words, charts of one particular 
			commodity may appear to have an identity or a character peculiar to that
			commodity. For example, cotton charts display many round tops and bottoms, and
			even a series of these constructions, which are seldom observed in soybeans and
			wheat. The examination of soybean charts over the years reveals that triangles are
			especially favored. Head and shoulders formations abound throughout the wheat
			charts. All commodities seem to favor certain behavior patterns.
		</code>
		<p>
			In addition to Jiler’s observation, the cattle futures market is recognized as also having 
			the unusual occurrence of “V” bottoms. Until recently, both the silver and pork belly 
			markets have tendencies to look very similar, with long periods of sideways movement
			and short-lived but violent price shocks, where prices leap rather than trend to a new
			level. The fi nancial markets have equally unique personalities. The S&P traditionally
			makes new highs, then immediately falls back; it has fast, short-lived drops and slower,
			steadier gains. Currencies show intermediate trends bounded by noticeable major stopping 
			levels while interest rates and bonds have long-term trends.
		</p>
		<p>
			Charting remains the most popular and practical form for evaluating price movement, 
			and numerous works have been written on methods of interpretation. This chapter will 
			summarize some of the accepted approaches to charting and the trading rules
			normally associated with these patterns. Some conclusions are drawn as to what is
			most likely to work and why. The next chapter covers systems that are derived from
			these patterns and are designed to take advantage of behavioral patterns found in
			charts.
