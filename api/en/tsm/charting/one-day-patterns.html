		<h2>One-Day Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			The easiest of all chart patterns to recognize occur in one day. They include gaps, spikes,
			island reversals, reversal days, inside days, outside days, wide-ranging days, and, to a
			lesser extent, thrust days. Some of these patterns are important at the moment they
			occur, and others must be confi rmed by other factors.
		</p>
		<h3>Gaps</h3>
		<p>
			Price gaps occur when important news influences the market at a time when the exchange is closed. 
			Orders accumulate to be executed on the next open. An upwards gap
			exists when the low of the current day is higher than the high of the previous day. If all
			trading were 24 hours, then we would see a fast, volatile move, but not a gap. For example, 
			there are three popular ways to trade the S&P 500 index, 
			<ol>
				<li>Futures, traded in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange pit from 8:30 A.M. to 3:15 P.M.
					(Central time)</li>
				<li>Spyders (SPY) on the AMEX during the same hours</li>
				<li> The electronic S&P mini-futures contract which trades nonstop from Sunday evening
					at 6 P.M. until Friday afternoon at 3:15 P.M. on the Globex platform</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Gaps only exist when using the primary trading session (the pit session). Most
			afterhours trading is on light volume and may be ignored for charting purposes. An
			exception is in Europe where they have an extended session from the original 4 P.M. close
			(European time) to 10 P.M. or 10:30 P.M. to allow trading at the same time the U.S. markets
			are open. The markets then close and reopen when the normal European business day
			begins. For European markets it is best to use the combined sessions that start at about
			9 A.M. and continue until about 10 P.M.
		</p>
		<p>
			Economic reports are released by the U.S. government at 7:30 A.M. (Central time);
			therefore, they occur before the S&P pit trading and the SPDRs begin trading, but during the 
			electronic emini S&P session. There is no gap in electronic trading, but the other
			markets will open sharply higher or lower to adjust to the current emini price. When the
			fi nancial news shows give the expected open of the stock market, they are using the difference 
			between the previous NYSE closing price and the current price of the electronic
			session. This creates frequent opening gaps in those markets.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gaps can also occur because of a large cluster of orders placed at the point where
			the stock or futures market penetrates support or resistance. It is possible to have a
			gap during the trading session, immediately following bullish economic report, or 
			concurrent with an anticipated news release of consequence, when there are a large
			number of buyers and few sellers. There is also the rarer case of an event shock such as
			September 11, 2001.
		</p>
		<p>
			In charting, gaps are interpreted differently based on where they occur in the current
			price pattern. In some cases, a gap signals a continued move and in other situations it is
			expected to be the end of a price move. The four primary gap formations are shown on a
			chart of Amazon.com in Figure 3.13. They are:
			<ol>
				<li>
					The common gap, which appears as a space on a chart and has no particular
					attributes—that is, it does not occur at a point associated with any particular signifi -
					cance. A common gap appears in May 1999 during a downward move.
				</li>
				<li>
					A breakaway gap occurs at a point of clear resistance or support. It occurs when
					there are a large number of buy orders just above a major resistance line, or sell
					orders below a support line. Most often this is seen after a prolonged period of sideways 
					price movement when most chartists can draw the same horizontal support
					and resistance lines. The clearer the formation, and the longer the sideways period,
					the more likely there will be a large breakaway gap. The term breakaway requires
					some hindsight because it is applied only when the gap is followed by a sustained
					price move.
					<p>
						There are two breakaway gaps in Figure 3.13, the first shortly after prices make a
						new high, the second in the middle of the chart when prices break upwards through 
						a steep downward trendline, and the last near the right of the chart when prices gap
						through a clear downwards trendline.
					</p>
					<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/price-gaps.png" alt="Price Gaps" width="100%">
					<p>
						In order to trade a gap, a position must be entered in advance of the gap, as prices
						approach the support or resistance level. Once a long position is set and prices gap
						up you gain free exposure, which is the profi t caused by the gap or by a fast market
						move in your favor. If prices do not gap up, they most often drift lower. The position
						can be exited with a small loss and reentered later.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					An exhaustion gap occurs at the end of a sustained and volatile price move and confirms the reversal. 
					Exhaustion gaps usually occur on the day after the highest price
					of the upwards move; however, in the Amazon chart, it is one day later. Because it
					signifies a clustering of orders anxious to exit the long side, it has all the signs associated with an exhaustion gap.
				</li>
				<li>
					A runaway gap occurs at different points during a clear trend and confirms the
					trend. It does not appear to have any practical use because the trend can stop and
					reverse just after a runaway gap and it will be renamed an island top, or some other
					formation. When holding a long position, an upwards runaway gap quickly adds profits, 
					but also signifies extreme risk.
				</li>
			</ol>
			Gaps can also be a hindrance to trading. A long position held when a downward
			breakaway gap occurs guarantees that any stop-loss order is executed far away from
			the order price. If the upwards breakaway gap occurs on light volume, it may be a false
			breakout. If a short is held, and if you are lucky, prices will fall back to the breakout level
			and then continue lower. If unlucky, you will be executed at the high of the move. In the
			fi nal analysis, if the gap breakout represents a major change, a trade should be entered
			immediately at the market. The poor executions will be offset by the one time when
			prices move quickly and no pullback occurs. A breakaway gap on high volume is usually
			indicative of a strong move and a sustained change.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Filling the Gap
		</h3>
		<p>
			Tradition states that prices will retrace to fill the gap that occurred sometime earlier.
			Naturally, given enough time, prices will return to most levels; therefore, nearly all gaps
			will eventually be filled. The most important gaps are not filled for some time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The gap represents an important point at which prices move out of their previous
			pattern and begin a new phase. The breakaway gap will often occur just above the previous normal, 
			or established, price level. With commodities, once the short-term demand
			imbalance has passed, prices should return to near-normal (perhaps slightly above the
			old prices given inflation), but also slightly below the gap. When a stock price gaps higher
			based on earnings, a new product announcement, or a rumor of an acquisition, the price
			may not return to the previous level.
		</p>
		<p>
			A computer study of opening gaps, and a program that performs the study, can be
			found in Chapter 15. It shows the probabilities of subsequent price moves following gaps,
			based on different-sized gaps, in a wide selection of markets. Bulkowski has a large section 
			devoted to gaps, some of which will be covered in Chapter 4.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Trading Rules for Gaps
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				A common gap is small and occurs with low volume and for no specific reason; that
				is, it is not the result of an obvious, surprising news release. Active traders will take
				a position counter to the direction of the gap, expecting the move to reverse and fill
				the gap, at which point they will take profits. If the gap is not fi lled within a few days,
				the trade is liquidated.
			</li>
			<li>
				A breakaway gap is the result of bunched orders at an obvious support or resistance
				area. When a clear sideways pattern has developed, place a buy order just under the
				resistance level in order to benefi t from the jump in prices (free exposure) when the
				breakout occurs. If a gap occurs on the breakout, then prices should continue higher.
			</li>
			<li>
				A runaway gap is often found in the middle of a significant move. It is considered a
				good point to add to your position because the runaway gap confi rms the move and
				offers additional potential profits.
			</li>
			<li>
				An exhaustion gap is best traded as it is being filled, and, even at that stage, it is
				highly risky. Sell during the move upwards, placing a stop above the previous high
				of the move. If this pattern fails, prices could move higher in an explosive pattern. If
				you are successive, profi ts could also be large.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Bulkowski on Gaps
		</h3>
		<p>
			Bulkowski includes an extensive study of breakaway, continuation, and exhaustion gaps.
			The statistics developed for these three cases all conform to the expected patterns, as
			shown in Table 3.1. Almost by definition, we expect a breakaway gap, one that occurs
			when prices move out of a sideways range, to mark the beginning of a new trend, and the
			exhaustion gap (which actually can’t be seen until it reverses) to be the end of a trend.
			The continuation gap is somewhere in between and is only defi ned within the context of
			an existing trend.
		</p>
		<p>
			The results of the breakaway gap, only 1% and 6% retracements, confirm that the
			breakouts often continue the trend direction. Strategies that take advantage of this are
			the N-day breakout, swing trading, and pivot point breakouts, providing that the observation 
			period is greater than 40 days, the minimum considered to be a macrotrend.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Spikes
		</h3>
		<p>
			A spike is a single, highly volatile day where the price moves much higher or lower than it
			has in the recent past. A spike can only be recognized one day later because trading range
			of the following day must be much lower. It is easiest to show spikes in markets, such as
			U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds, that react to frequent economic reports. In Figure 3.14 there
			is a series of three spikes about four weeks apart.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/stats-of-time-gaps.png" alt="" width="100%">
		<p>
			An upward spike, as shown in Figure 3.14, is always a local top because a spike is
			a day with above-average volatility and must be bracketed by two lower days. In all
			three cases shown, the spike represented the high price for at least one week. Because
			the spike is a clear top, when prices begin to rise again, they usually meet resistance at
			the top of the spike. Chartists draw a horizontal resistance line using the high price of
			the spike, which encourages selling at that level. After each spike the chart is marked
			with “failed test,” showing the price level where resistance, based on the previous
			spike, slowed the advance. The spike did not stop the trend, but it did cause a unique
			pattern.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Quantifying Spikes
		</h3>
		<p>
			A spike has only one dominant feature: a price high or low much higher or lower than
			recent prices. It must therefore also have high volatility. The easiest way to identify an
			upside spike is to compare the trading range on the day of the spike to previous ranges
			and to the subsequent day. This can be programmed in TradeStation by using the true
			range function and satisfying the conditions that the high on the day of the spike is
			greater than the previous and subsequent highs by the amount of k × average true range
			over n days,
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/spikes-in-bonds.png" alt="Spikes in Bonds" width="100%">
		<code>
			Spike = high[1] - highest(high,n)[2] > k*average(truerange,n)[2] and
					high[1] - high > k*average(truerange,n)[2]
		</code>
		<p>
			In this code, spike is a logical variable (true-false). A spike that occurs yesterday
			(where [1] indicates yesterday and [2] two days ago) is tested to see that the high of the
			spike is greater than the high of the previous n days, greater than the average true range of
			the same n days by a factor of k, and also greater than the high of today by the same factor
			k. Note that the use of [2] ends the true range calculation on the day before the spike. The
			value of k should be greater than 0.75. Spikes satisfying k > 1 are more desirable but less
			frequent.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Excel, the true range is
			<code>
				TRn = Max(Hn - Ln,Hn - Cm,Cm - Ln)
			</code>
			where n is the current row, m is the previous row (n-1), and the high, low, and close (H, L,
			can C) are in columns B, C, and D.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Island Reversals
		</h3>
		<p>
			An island reversal or an island top is a single price bar, or group of bars, sitting at the top
			of a price move and isolated by a gap on both sides, before and after the island formation.
			Combined with high volatility, this formation has the reputation of being a major turning
			point. The gap on the right side of the island top can be considered an exhaustion gap. In
			Figure 3.15, showing AMR during the fi rst part of 2003, there is one island reversal in midApril. 
			This single, volatile day has a low that is higher than both the previous day and the
			following day. It remains the high for the next week but eventually gives way to another
			volatile price rise. Island bottoms also occur, but are less frequent.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Pivot Point Reversals and Swings
		</h3>
		<p>
			A pivot point is a trading day, or price bar, that is higher or lower than the bars that come
			before and after. If the entire bar is above the previous day and the following day, the
			pivot point reversal is the same as the island reversal. If it is a very volatile upwards day
			but the low price is not above the high of the surrounding bars, then it is a spike. If it is
			not a volatile day, then it is a weaker form of a spike. If you were plotting swing highs
			and lows, the high of an upwards pivot point reversal day would often become the swing
			high. It is common to locate a swing high by comparing the high of any day with two or
			more days before and after. The patterns of the days on either side of the high bar are not
			important as long as the middle bar has the highest high. When more days are used to
			identify pivot points, these reversals are expected to be more significant; however, they
			take longer to identify.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/classic-island-reversal.png" alt="classic island reversal" width="100%">
		<p>
			According to tests by Colby and Meyers,13 entries that occur based on a breakout of
			the highs or lows of the pivot points, called pivot point channels, are much more reliable
			than simply entering in the direction of the reversal based on the close of the last bar of
			the pivot point formation. For traders not interested in this very short-term strategy, a
			pivot point may help entry timing for any longer term method.
		</p>
		<p>
			More recently, Colby14 tested a Pivot Point Reverse Trading System, using the
			following rules:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Buy (and close out short positions) when a pivot point bottom occurs and the close
					is higher than the previous close.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sell (and close out long positions) when a pivot point top occurs and the close is
					lower than the previous close.
				</li>
			</ul>
			Applying these rules to the Dow Jones Industrials (DJIA) for 101 years ending December 2000 showed 
			nearly 7,000 trades (70 per year) with significant profits. Other tests
			of pivot points can be found in Chapter 4.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Cups and Caps
		</h3>
		<p>
			Another name given to the pivot point reversals are cups and caps, each determined by
			only three price bars, although another formation with the same name, cup with handle,
			is similar to a longer-term rounded bottom followed by a sideways or slight downward
			trend and a breakout to the upside. These two short-term formations are associated with
			trading rules that are identical to pivot point channels applied to the shortest time frame.
			Although some literature uses these formations backwards, a cap formation identifi es a
			sell signal when the trend is up, while a cup is a setup for a buy signal in a downtrend.
			Once an uptrend is clear, a cap formation is found using either the daily closes or daily
			lows. For any three consecutive days, the middle day must have the highest close or the
			highest low. In a cup pattern, the middle day must have the lowest low or the lowest
			close of the 3-day cluster. In both cases, the positioning of the highs and lows of the other
			two days are not important as long as the middle day is lower for the cup and higher for
			the cap.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cup will generate a buy signal if:
			<ul>
				<li>
					The cup formation is the lowest point of the downtrend
				</li>
				<li>
					The buy signal occurs within three days of the cup formation
				</li>
				<li>
					The current price closes above the highest high (middle bar) of the cup formation
				</li>
			</ul>
			The signal is false if prices reverse and close below the low of the cup formation,
			resuming the previous downtrend. This pattern is only expected to forecast a downward
			price move of two days; however, every change of direction must start somewhere, and
			this formation could offer an edge. A cap formation is traded with the opposite rules.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Reversal Days and Key Reversal Days
		</h3>
		<p>
			A day in which there is a new high followed by a lower close is a downwards reversal
			day. An upwards reversal day is a new low followed by a higher close. A reversal day is
			a common formation, as seen in Figure 3.16, the Russell 2000 futures. Some of these days
			are identifi ed; however, you can fi nd many other examples in Figures 3.13 through 3.16.
			There have been many studies to determine the importance of reversal days for trading,
			but these are inconclusive. In Chapter 15 there is a detailed study of reversal days, indicating 
			the likelihood of a subsequent price move based on this reversal pattern and other
			combinations. A reversal day by itself is not significant unless it can be put into context
			with a larger price pattern, such as a clear trend with sharply increasing volatility, or a
			reversal that occurs at the highest or lowest price of the past few weeks.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Key Reversals
		</h3>
		<p>
			A key reversal day is a more selective pattern, and has been endowed with great forecasting power. 
			It is also called an outside reversal day, and is a weaker form of an island
			reversal. A bearish key reversal is formed in one day by fi rst making a new high in an upward trend, 
			reversing to make a low that is lower than the previous low, and then closing
			below the previous close. It should be associated with higher volatility. Examples of key
			reversal days can be seen in Figures 3.14 and 3.15. It is considered more reliable when
			the trend is well-established.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/key-reversal-days.png" alt="key-reversal-days" width="100%">
		<p>
			As with reversal days, studies have shown mixed results using the key reversal as a
			sole trading indicator. The most complete analysis,15 similar to others, concluded that the
			performance was “strikingly unimpressive.” Even though tests have not proved its importance, 
			traders still pay close attention to key reversals. Because this pattern has kept its
			importance, we can conclude that other factors unconsciously enter into the selection of
			key reversal days for trading. A successful trader’s senses should not be underestimated;
			the extent and speed of the prior trend, a change in liquidity, a quieter market tone, or
			some external news may be essential in confirming the important reversals. The job of
			a system developer is to fi nd those factors that will turn this pattern into a successful
			indicator. The best place to start is by assuming the attitude of those traders who see a
			reversal day as an important pattern. As noted earlier, a comprehensive study of reversal
			days and other patterns can be found in Chapter 15.
		</p>
		<p>
			Figure 3.16 shows a number of reversal days during the rapid drop of the Russell
			2000 in January 2002. Three patterns of particular interest are the reversal days at the two
			extreme lows in July and October 2002, and the high in between, during August. Although
			there are many other reversal days embedded within other parts of the price move, the
			reversals off the lows are clearly at higher volatility than most other days, and follow very
			sharp, accelerating price drops. The reversal day that ends the intermediate high during
			August does not share these attributes; however, it tops a pattern that is not the dominant
			trend, but an upwards reaction within a previous sustained downtrend. If we focus on the
			characteristics of those reversal days that mark price extremes, rather than all reversal
			days, we should expect successful results.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Programming Key Reversal Days
		</h3>
		<p>
			A key reversal day can be recognized and tested using a computer program. In
			TradeStation’s EasyLanguage the instructions for downward key reversal are
		</p>
		<code>
			KeyReversalDown = 0;
			if close[1] > average(close[1],n) and high >= highest(high[1],n) and
				low < low[1] and close < close[1] then KeyReversalDown = 1;
		</code>
		<p>
			where the fi rst term tests for an uptrend over n-days, the second term tests that the current day 
			is the highest price of the same n-days, the third term verifi es that a lower low
			has occurred, and the last term tests for a lower close. This can be done in Excel by using the 
			max and min functions instead of highest and lowest. A TradeStation function to
			identify key reversals is TSM Key Reversals and can be found on the Companion Website
			along with an Excel spreadsheet of the same name.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adding a volatility factor, so that the key reversal day has noticeably higher volatility than the 
			previous days seems to select more signifi cant patterns. In the spreadsheet, which uses heating 
			oil from 2005 through 2011 as an example, the basic rules gave
 			marginal gains, but a fi lter that took only trades where today’s true range was greater
			than 1.5 × average prior 20-day true range was much better.
		</p>
		<h3>
			2-Bar Reversal Patterns
		</h3>
		<p>
			Martin Pring16 has called attention to a special 2-bar reversal pattern that frequently precedes a 
			strong directional change. This pattern consists of two days that are essentially
			the mirror image of one another. Consider a market in which prices have been moving
			steadily higher. The first day of the pattern shows a volatile upwards move with prices
			opening near the lows and closing near the highs. On the following day, prices open
			where they had closed, trade slightly higher (nearly matching the previous day’s highs),
			then fall sharply to close near the lows, giving back all of the previous day’s move.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following the 2-bar reversal to the downside, the next few days should not trade
			above the midpoint of the 2-bar reversal pattern. The smaller the retracement, the more
			likely there will be a good sell-off.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is easy to explain the psychology of this pattern. The fi rst bar represents the strong
			bullish feeling of the buyers, while the second bar is seen as complete discouragement at
			the inability to follow through to even higher levels. It will take some days before traders are
			willing to test the highs again. More traders may view this as a potential major reversal. High
			volume can confi rm the reversal. The nature of the move to follow depends on the extent
			of the previous trend and the volatility. Four key factors in predicting a strong reversal are:
			<ol>
				<li>Stronger preceding trends</li>
				<li>Wider, more volatile 2-bar patterns</li>
				<li>Greater volume than in previous days</li>
				<li>Smaller retracements following the 2-bar pattern</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Wide-Ranging Days, Inside Days, and Outside Days
		</h3>
		<p>
			A wide-ranging day is a day of much higher volatility than recent days, but no requirement that it is 
			higher or lower than other days. An outside day must have both a higher
			high and lower low than the previous day. Inside days are an example of volatility compression. All three 
			patterns are very common but indicate that something special has
			happened. Examples of these patterns are shown in Figure 3.17, a one-year, active trading
			period for Tyco ending in July 2000, before any accounting scandal surfaced.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Wide-Ranging Days
		</h3>
		<p>
			A wide-ranging day is likely to be the result of a price shock, unexpected news, or a
			breakout in which many orders trigger one another, causing a large increase in volatility.
			A wide-ranging day could turn out to be a spike or an island reversal. Because very high
			volatility cannot be sustained, we can expect that a wide-ranging day will be followed by
			a reversal, or at least a pause. When a wide-ranging day occurs, the direction of the close
			(if the close is near the high or low) is a strong indication of the continued direction.
		</p>
		<p>
			A wide-ranging day is easily seen on a chart because it has at least twice, or three
			times the volatility of the previous trading days. There is no requirement that it makes a
			new high or low relative to a recent move, or that it closes higher or lower. It is simply a
			very volatile day.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Outside Days
		</h3>
		<p>
			An outside day often precedes a reversal. An outside day can also be a wide-ranging day
			if the volatility is high, but when volatility is low and the size of the bar is slightly longer
			than the previous bar, it is a weak signal. As with so many other chart patterns, if one 
			day has an unusually small trading range, followed by an outside day of normal volatility,
			there is very little information in the pattern. Selection is important.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/wide-ranging-days-outside-days-inside-days.png" alt="wide ranging days outside days and inside days" width="100%">
		<h3>
			Inside Days
		</h3>
		<p>
			An inside day is one where the high is lower than the previous high and the low is higher
			than the previous low. That is, an inside day is one where both the highs and lows are
			inside the previous day’s trading range.
		</p>
		<p>
			An inside day represents consolidation and lower volatility. In turn, lower volatility is
			most often associated with the end of a price move. After a burst of activity and a surge
			of upward direction, prices have reached a point where the buyers are already in and the
			price has moved too far to attract more buyers. Volume drops, volatility drops, and we
			get an inside day. An inside day is often followed by a change of direction, but that is not
			guaranteed. We only know that the event that drove prices up is now over. If more news
			surfaces to ignite prices, the next move could just as easily be up as down
		</p>
		<p>
			In Figure 3.17 there are two inside days at the price peak on the top left of the Tyco
			chart. The first inside day is followed by a small move lower, then a small move higher,
			followed by another inside day. This last inside day precedes a major sell-off. On the right
			top of the chart there are two inside days immediately before another sharp drop.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some analysts believe that a breakout from low volatility is more reliable than one
			following high volatility. For those readers interested in these patterns, a quantitative
			study of wide-ranging, inside days, and outside days can be found in Chapter 4.
		</p>
		<h3>Some Notes about 1-Day Patterns</h3>
		<p>
			One-day patterns are very common; therefore, traders tend to be selective about when
			they are used. Taken as a group, patterns that are repeated frequently are less reliable
			and need to be combined with other patterns. Those that occur during periods of high or
			low volatility or volume may also be less dependable.
		</p>
		<p>
			While a reversal day is clearly a 1-day formation and can be identified at the end of the
			trading day, and an opening gap is recognized instantly, most other 1-day patterns are not
			clear until the day after. An upwards spike and a downwards pivot point reversal both require
			the high of the next day to be much lower than the high of the spike or pivot day; and the 
			island reversal must show a gap on the following day. Although they cannot be used at the end
			of the day on which they occur, these formations are reasonably timely for an active trader.
