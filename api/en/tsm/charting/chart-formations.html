		<h2>CHART FORMATIONS</h2>
		<p>
			While Dow Theory is a macro view of price movement, more often chart analysis deals
            with much shorter time periods. Most traders hold positions from a few days to a few
            weeks; however, they apply the same patterns to both shorter or longer intervals.
		</p>
        <p>
            Chart analysis uses straight lines and geometric formations on price charts. It analyzes 
            volume only in the most general terms of advancing and declining phases. Chart
            patterns can be classifi ed into the broad groups of:
            <ul>
                <li>Trendlines and channels</li>
                <li>One-day patterns</li>
                <li>Continuation patterns</li>
                <li>Accumulation and distribution (tops and bottoms)</li>
                <li>Retracements</li>
                <li>Other patterns</li>
            </ul>
            Of these, the most important is the trendline.
        </p>
        <h3>The Trend in Retrospect</h3>
        <p>
            It is easier to see the trend on a chart after it has occurred. Trying to identify the trend as
            it is developing is much more diffi cult. The monthly chart in Figure 3.6 shows a sustained
            uptrend trend, but there is a slowing of that trend toward the end. Will the upward trend
            continue? Will prices begin a downward trend? Will they move sideways? The purpose of
            charting is to apply tools that provide the best chance of identifying the future direction
            of prices. If wrong, these tools also control the size of the loss.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time interval is a key element when identifying a trend. Weekly and monthly
            charts show the major trends more clearly than daily charts. Longer-term charts remove
            much of the noise that interferes with seeing the bigger picture. Many chartists start
            by evaluating a weekly or monthly chart, then apply the lines and values developed on
            those charts to a daily chart. The weekly chart provides direction or biases the direction
            of trades while the daily chart, or even a 15-minute chart, is used for timing entries and
            exits. Further discussion of this can be found in Chapter 19.
