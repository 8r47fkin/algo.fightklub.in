		<h2>Continuation Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			Continuation patterns occur during a trend and help to explain the stage of development
			of that trend. A continuation pattern that occurs within a long-term trend is expected to
			be resolved by continuing in the direction of the trend. If prices fail to move in the 
			direction of the trend following a major continuation pattern, then the trend is considered
			over. The primary continuation patterns are triangles, flags, pennants, and wedges. The
			larger formations of these patterns are more important than the smaller ones.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Symmetric, Descending, and Ascending Triangles
		</h3>
		<p>
			Triangles tend to be larger formations that occur throughout a trend. A symmetric triangle 
			is most likely to occur at the beginning of a trend when there is greater uncertainty about 
			direction. A symmetric triangle is formed by a price consolidation, where
			uncertainty of buyers and sellers results in decreasing volatility in such a way that prices
			narrow to the center of the previous trading range. In Figure 3.18 the symmetric triangle
			is formed at about the level of the previous support. The breakout from a symmetric triangle 
			often marks the beginning of a longer-term trend.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Formation of a Descending Triangle
		</h3>
		<p>
			Even during a clear downward trend, prices will rally. Because the trend is clear, sellers
			are anxious to step in and sell these upwards moves, looking for the trend to continue.
			The top of this mid-trend rally is likely to be the last support point where prices broke
			out of a previous pattern. In Figure 3.18, the top of the fi rst descending triangle comes
			very close to the breakout level of the symmetric triangle, and the larger descending
			triangle towards the lower right of the chart has its high point at the breakout of another
			descending triangle.
		</p>
		<p>
			The recent lows of the new trend form a temporary support level, and prices may
			bounce off that level while short-term traders play for small profi ts. This action forms
			a descending triangle. As more traders are convinced that prices are still heading lower, 
			rallies off the support level are sold sooner, causing a narrower pattern, until prices
			finally break below support. The descending triangle is complete. In an upwards trend an
			ascending triangle would be formed.

		<h3>
			Size of the Triangles
		</h3>
		<p>
			A triangle should take no less than two weeks to form; however, they can span a much
			longer period, occasionally up to three months. Larger formations represent periods of
			greater uncertainty. They may be followed by another symmetric triangle, again indicating 
			that traders are undecided about direction. If the symmetric triangle is resolved in
			the current trend direction, the trend is in full force, and a large price move is expected.
		</p>
		<p>
			Triangles can be consistent indicators of investor confidence. Because they reflect
			human behavior, they are not always perfect in appearance and not always consistent in
			pattern. It takes experience to identify the formation in a timely manner.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Flags
		</h3>
		<p>
			A flag is a smaller pattern than a triangle, generally less than three months for the 
			longterm trader, and is formed by a correction in a bull market or a rally in a bear market. A
			flag is a congestion area that leans away from the direction of the trend and typically can
			be isolated by drawing parallel lines across the top and bottom of the formation. At the
			beginning of a trend, the flags may not lean away from the direction of the new trend as
			clearly as during a well-established trend. If the first flag after an upwards breakout leans
			down, it confi rms the new upwards trend.
		</p>
		<p>
			Figure 3.19 shows an assortment of triangles, flags, and pennants. There are two
			small flags, one in the middle of the chart and one in the lower right, each leaning 
			upwards as expected in a downtrend. A larger flag slightly below center could also have
			been a symmetric triangle. Both patterns are resolved by a continuation of the trend.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Pennants
		</h3>
		<p>
			Pennants are irregular triangles normally leaning toward the trend, similar to a descending 
			triangle in a downtrend but without a horizontal support line. A typical pennant can
			be seen in the middle of Figure 3.19. During a sustained trend, triangles are large, clear
			formations, with horizontal support or resistance lines, while pennants are consolidation
			formations requiring only that the lines converge. They usually lean in the direction of the
			trend, but that is not a requirement. A larger pennant should lean in the direction of
			the trend in a manner similar to a descending triangle; however, a small pennant may
			serve the same purpose as a flag and lean away from the trend.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Wedges
		</h3>
		<p>
			A pattern that looks as if it is a large pennant, with both sides angling in the same direction, 
			but does not come to a point, is a wedge. In an upwards-trending market, the wedge
			should be rising as shown on the right side of the General Electric chart, Figure 3.20, near
			the end of 1999. The earlier wedge has nearly a horizontal upper line, bridging the pattern
			between a wedge and a rising triangle. A rising wedge is formed in the same way as an
			ascending triangle. Investors, convinced that the share price will rise, will buy smaller
			and smaller reversals even as prices make new highs. In the end, prices continue in the
			direction of the trend. In a typical rising wedge the lower line has a steeper angle than
			the upper line.
		</p>

		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/wedge.png" alt="wedge formation" width="100%">
		<p>
			The angle of the wedge should be steeper as the trend becomes clear. The earlier
			wedge formation shown in Figure 3.20 is nearly symmetric. If we study the bigger picture,
			we can see that the uncertainty at the beginning of the trend is reflected in the symmetric
			formation, while the rising wedge occurs after the trend is well established and investors
			anticipate a continuation.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Run Days
		</h3>
		<p>
			Triangles, flags, pennants, and wedges represent the best of the continuation patterns.
			They can be identified clearly while they are still being formed and the direction of the
			breakout can be anticipated and traded. Other formations, such as run days, are not as
			timely. A run day occurs when the low of that day is higher than the previous n days, and
			the high of the day is lower than the subsequent n highs. When it occurs, this pattern 
			confirms that a trend is in effect. The more days used to define the run day, the stronger the
			pattern. Therefore, a 5-day run day requires 11 days to identify, 5 before the run day and
			5 after. Unlike the other continuation patterns, which have a breakout level that can be
			used as a trading signal, entering a long position after 11 days of a strong upwards move
			is not likely to be a good entry point. There are no trading rules or trading action 
			associated with run days. They simply confi rm what you have already seen on chartsâ€”that
			prices have been trending.
