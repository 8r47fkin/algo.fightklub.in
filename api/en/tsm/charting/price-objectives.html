		<h2>Price Objectives for Bar Charting</h2>
		<p>
			Most traders set price objectives and use them to assess the risk and reward of a potential trade. 
			Objectives are most reasonable for short-term trading and successful objectives are based on 
			straightforward concepts and not complex calculations. There is also
			a noticeable similarity between the price objectives for different chart patterns.
		</p>
		<p>
			The simplest and most logical price objective is a major support or resistance level
			established by previous trading. When entering a long position, look at the most welldefined 
			resistance levels above the entry point. These have been discussed in previous
			sections of this chapter. When those prior levels are tested, there is generally a technical
			adjustment or a reversal. The more well-established the support or resistance level, the
			more likely prices will stop. In the case of a strong upwards move, volatility often causes
			a small penetration before the setback occurs. A penetration of support or resistance,
			followed by a return to the previous trading range is considered a confirmation of the
			old range and a false breakout. Placing the price objective for a long position below the
			identifi able major resistance level will always be safe. The downside objective can be
			identifi ed in a similar manner: Find the major support level and exit just above it.
		</p>
		<p>
			When trading with chart patterns, it pays to be flexible. Regardless of which method
			you use to identify a profi t target, be prepared to take profi ts sooner if the market 
			changes. For example, you have entered a long in IBM at $160 and set your profit objective at
			$200. Prices move as predicted and reach $195 when volume starts to drop and the price
			pattern seems to move sideways. An experienced trader will say “close enough” and take
			the profit. Profit objectives are not perfect, only good guidelines. If you have set a single
			price target for a long position, and it falls slightly above a resistance level, then the lower
			resistance level should be used as the price objective.
		</p>
		<p>
			One practical solution that will be discussed in Chapter 22 is using multiple profit-targets.
			Rather than rely on a single point, traders will fan out their target points around the most
			likely objective, dividing their goal into three or five levels. As each profit-target is reached
			the risk of the current trade is reduced as is the likelihood of turning a profit into a loss.
		</p>
		<p>
			While waiting for prices to reach the objective, remember to watch for a violation of
			the current trend; trend changes take priority over profit objectives. If the trade is successful, 
			and the goal is reached as expected, watch for a new pattern. If prices decline
			after the trade is closed out, then reverse and break through the previous highs or lows,
			the position may be reentered on the breakout and a new price objective calculated.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Common Elements of Profit Objectives
		</h3>
		<p>
			Most chart formations have a price objective associated with them. The common ground
			for all of them is volatility. Each chart pattern is larger or smaller because of the current
			price volatility; therefore, the price targets derived from these formations are also based
			on volatility. In general, the price objective refl ects the same volatility as the chart 
			formation and is measured from the point where prices break out of the pattern.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Profit Targets for Consolidation Areas and Channels
		</h3>
		<p>
			The most basic of all formations is the horizontal consolidation area, bounded on the top
			and bottom by a horizontal resistance and support lines. There are two possible profit
			targets, shown in Figure 3.34.
			<ol>
				<li>
					For any horizontal consolidation pattern, the target is above the breakout of the
					resistance line at a point equal to the height of the consolidation area (the resistance
					level minus the support level added to the resistance level). That makes the expected
					move equal to the extreme volatility of the consolidation area.
				</li>
				<li>
					With extended rectangular formations, the upwards profi t target is calculated as the
width of the consolidation pattern added to the support level.
				</li>
				<p>
					Although price objective (2) is a well-known and popular calculation, it is unrealistic
					when the extended formation is very prolonged. The standard calculation, given in (1), is
					more reasonable. A third objective is more conservative but even more practical:
				</p>
				<li>
					Use the average volatility of the consolidation formation, or reduce the target in (1)
					above by 20% to remove the extremes from influencing the objectives. A closer price
					target will be reached more often.
				</li>
			</ol>
			The price objective for a channel is the same as the traditional objective for a horizontal consolidation 
			pattern. Because the channel is at an angle, it is necessary to measure the width of the channel as perpendicular 
			to the angled support and resistance channel lines; then project that width upwards from the point of breakout. 
			The length of the channel does not change the profit target. Again, you may want to make the target slightly
			smaller than the original channel.

		<h3>
			Changing Price Objectives Using Channels
		</h3>
		<p>
			Price objectives can be found as trends change and new channels are formed. Figure 3.35
			shows the change from an upwards to a downwards trend. Once a breakout of an upwards
			channel has occurred (marked “First point of reversal”), we wait until the low is reached 
			at a, followed by the reaction back up to b. A resistance line, 1R, can be drawn from the
			prior high h to the top of the latest move b. A line, 1S, can be constructed parallel to 1R
			passing through point a, forming the initial downward channel. Price objective 1 is on line
			1S of the new channel and is used once the top at point b is determined. Price objective 1
			cannot be expected to be too precise due to the early development of the channel. If prices
			continue to point c and then rally to d, a more reasonable channel can now be defi ned
			using trendlines 2R and 2S. The support line will again become the point where the new
			price objective is placed. The upper and lower trendlines can be further refined as the new
			high and low reactions occur. The primary trendline is always drawn first; then the new
			price objective becomes a point on the parallel trendline.

		<h3>
			Targeting Profits after Tops and Bottoms
		</h3>
		<p>
			Because profit targets are based on the volatility of the underlying pattern, the profit
			targets for all top and bottom formations will seem very much the same. Looking back
			at Figure 3.27, natural gas, there is a triple top formation. Between each top is a reversal
			marking an important support level. The first pullback after the island reversal brought
			prices to 8.20, followed by a test of the top that formed the second peak. The second retracement 
			stopped at 9.00 and was followed by the third peak. When prices finally drop
			through the highest support level at 9.00, we can treat it as a breakout and sell short.
		</p>
		<p>
			If this chart showed a double top, then the point where prices fall below the support
			between two tops confirms the top. Breaking this support level indicates that the topping
			formation is completed. But this was not a double top; therefore, we can take the lower
			of the two support levels between the three tops as the major confirmation of the pattern.
			In the natural gas chart, the lower support was at 8.20. Using either support level gives a
			measurement of the triple top pattern based on the volatility of prices.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Calculating the Profit Target for a Top Formation
		</h3>
		<p>
			The profit target is found by measuring the height of the top formation and projecting it
			downwards from the point where the top is confirmed, that is, the break of the support
			level. For this example, profit targets will be calculated based on each of the support
			levels. The highest price of the move is 10.75. Let’s examine two profi t targets:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Using the support level of 9.00, the height of the top is 10.75 – 9.00, or 1.75. 
					Projecting that downwards from the breakout point of 9.00 gives a profit objective of 7.25.
					The first major pause in the price drop stopped at about 7.00, still showing high
					volatility.
				</li>
				<li>
					Based on the second support level of 8.20, the height of the top is 2.65, and the profit
					objective, measured from the break at 8.20, is 5.55. Prices reach 5.55, but only after
					stalling at about 6.50.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			The first target is very achievable and realistic. Prices are very volatile, and a drop of 1.75
			could occur very quickly. The second target is less realistic. When targeting a much larger
			decline, and beginning at a much lower point, it is unrealistic to expect volatility to continue 
			at the same high level. In the decline of natural gas from January through March,
			volatility also declines, so that by March it appears as though the move is over. Although
			price targets can often be correct, those that are far away will be less reliable.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Profit Targets after a Bottom Formation
		</h3>
		<p>
			The same principle can be applied to calculate the profit target for bottom formations.
			The distance from the lowest price of the bottom to the confirmation point is projected
			upwards from the breakout. This method can be applied to any type of bottom formation.
			In Figure 3.26, the double bottom in Cisco spanned the price range from about 5.00 to
			6.25. The volatility of the bottom pattern, 1.25, is projected upwards from the breakout
			at 6.25 to get the target of 7.50. Because volatility should expand as prices rise, the exact
			volatility calculation can be used as a conservative measure.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The Head-and-Shoulders Price Objective
		</h3>
		<p>
			In keeping with other price targets, the head-and-shoulders top has a downside objective,
			which is also based on its volatility. This objective is measured from the point where the
			right shoulder penetrates the neckline and is equal to the distance from the top of the
			head to the neckline (Figure 3.36). For a major top, this goal seems modest, but it will
			be a good measure of the initial reaction and is generally safe, even if a new high price is
			reached later.
		</p>
		<p>
			A very similar example can be found in the Japanese yen (Figure 3.30). The neckline
			also angles up and to the right, and the price target finds the bottom of the first major
			support level following the break of the right shoulder. The position of the price objective
			is so significant that the subsequent drop in prices creates a breakaway gap.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Triangles and Flags
		</h3>
		<p>
			Triangles and flags have objectives based on volatility in a manner consistent with other
			patterns. The triangle objective is equal in size to the initial reaction, which formed the
			largest end of the triangle (Figure 3.37a). It may also be viewed as a developing channel 
			rather than a triangle, with the ascending leg of the triangle forming the primary bullish
			trendline. The price objective then becomes the same as those used for channels.
		</p>
		<p>
			The flag is assumed to occur midway in a price move; therefore, the objective of a
			new breakout must be equal to the size of the move preceding the fl ag (Figure 3.37b).
			Recalling the comments on the problems associated with the decreasing volatility of the
			triangular formation, the use of the fi rst reaction as a measure of volatility is a safe way
			to avoid problems. Using this technique with subsequent flags in a bull move will cause
			objectives to move farther away, becoming unrealistic.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The Rule of Seven
		</h3>
		<p>
			Another measurement of price objectives, the Rule of Seven, is credited to Arthur
			Sklarew.17 It is based on the volatility of the prior consolidation formation and
			computes three successive price objectives in proportion to one another. The Rule
			of Seven is not symmetric for both uptrends and downtrends. Sklarew believes that,
			after the initial leg of a move, the downtrend reactions are closer together than the
			reactions in a rising market. Because the downside of a major bear market is limited,
			it is usually characterized by consolidation. Major bull markets tend to expand as they
			develop.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/triangle-flag-objectives.png" alt="triangle-flag-objectives" width="100%">
		<p>
			To calculate the objectives using the Rule of Seven, first measure the length L of the
			initial leg of a price move (from the previous high or low, the most extreme point before
			the first pullback). The objectives are:
			<ol>
				<li>
					In an uptrend:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Upwards objective 1 = prior low + (L × 7/4)
						</li>
						<li>
							Upwards objective 2 = prior low + (L × 7/3)
						</li>
						<li>
							Upwards objective 3 = prior low + (L × 7/2)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					In a downtrend:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Downwards objective 1 = prior high − (L × 7/5)
						</li>
						<li>
							Downwards objective 2 = prior high − (L × 7/4)
						</li>
						<li>
							Downwards objective 3 = prior high − (L × 7/3)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			The three objectives apply most clearly to major moves. During minor price swings,
			it is likely that the first two objectives will be bypassed. In Sklarew’s experience, 
			regardless of whether any one objective is missed, the others still remain intact.
