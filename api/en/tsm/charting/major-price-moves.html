		<h2>What Causes the Major Price Moves and Trends?</h2>
		<p>
			Prices can move higher for many months or even years, creating a bull market. They can
			also move down, creating a bear market. Although price moves can be as short as a few
			minutes or as long as decades (as happened with interest rates and gold), it is how each
			chartist defi nes a “trend” that is most important. Once recognized, the price trend forms a
			bias for trading decisions that can make the difference between success and failure. The
			long-term direction of prices is driven by four primary factors:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Government policy. When economic policy targets a growth rate of 4%, and the current growth rate 
			is 1%, the Federal Reserve (the “Fed” or any central bank) lowers
			interest rates to encourage growth. Lowering rates stimulates business activity. The
			Fed raises interest rates and dampens economic activity to control infl ation. Changing 
			interest rates has a profound impact on the fl ow of investment money between
			countries, on international trade, on the value of currencies, and on business activity.
				</li>
				<li>
					International trade. When the United States imports goods, it pays for it in dollars.
					That is the same as selling the dollar. It weakens the currency. A country that continually 
					imports more than it exports increases its trade defi cit and weakens its currency. A country 
					that increases its exports strengthens its currency and its economy.
				</li>
				<li>
					Expectation. If investors think that stock prices will rise, they buy, causing prices
					to rise. Expectations can lead an economic recovery although there is no statistical
					data to support a recovery. Consumer confi dence is a good measure of how the public 
					feels about spending. The economy is active when consumer confidence is high.
					A lack of public confi dence following the subprime collapse dampened all economic
					activity and delayed the recovery for years.
				</li>
				<li>
					Supply and demand. A shortage, or anticipated shortage, of any product causes its
					price to rise. An oversupply of a product results in declining prices. These trends
					develop as news makes the public aware of the situation. A shortage of a product
					that cannot be replaced causes a prolonged effect on its price, although the jump to
					a higher price may happen quickly.
				</li>
			</ol>
