		<h2>The Bar Chart and its interpretation by Charles Dow</h2>
		<p>
			The bar chart, also called the line chart, became known through the theories of Charles
			H. Dow, who expressed them in the editorials of the Wall Street Journal. Dow fi rst formulated 
			his ideas in 1897 when he created the stock averages in order to have a more consistent measure 
			of price movement for stock groups. After Dow’s death in 1902, William
			P. Hamilton succeeded him and continued the development of his work into the theory
			that is known today. Those who have used charts extensively and understand their weak
			and strong points might be interested in just how far our acceptance has come. In the
			1920s, a New York newspaper was reported to have written:
		</p>
		<code>
			One leading banker deplores the growing use of charts by professional stock traders and customers’ men, 
			who, he says, are causing unwarranted market declines
			by purely mechanical interpretation of a meaningless set of lines. It is impossible,
			he contends, to figure values by plotting prices actually based on supply and demand; 
			but, he adds, if too many persons play with the same set of charts, they tend
			to create the very unbalanced supply and demand which upsets market trends. In
			his opinion, all charts should be confi scated, piled at the intersection of Broad and
			Wall and burned with much shouting and rejoicing.
		</code>
		<p>
			This attitude seems remarkably similar to the comments about program trading that
			followed the stock market plunge in October 1987, where it was condemned as the cause
			of the crash. In 2011 we again had comments about high frequency trading “manipulating”
			the markets, and in Europe they have banned short sales to stem volatility in the equity
			index markets. Of course, volatility continued to be high, but liquidity dropped. It’s politics, not logic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Charting has become an integral part of trading. The earliest authoritative works
			on chart analysis are long out of print, but the essential material has been recounted in
			newer publications. If, however, a copy should cross your path, read the original Dow
			Theory by Robert Rhea;
			7 most of all, read Richard W. Schabacker’s outstanding work
			Stock Market Theory and Practice, which is probably the basis for most subsequent texts
			on the use of the stock market for investment or speculation. The most available book
			that is both comprehensive and well written is Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by
			Edwards and Magee, now in its ninth edition.8 It is focused on chart analysis with related
			management implications and a small section on commodities. For the reader who prefers concise 
			information with few examples, the monograph by W. L. Jiler, Forecasting
			Commodity Prices with Vertical Line Charts, and a complementary piece, Volume and
			Open Interest: A Key to Commodity Price Forecasting, can still be found.9 Two more
			recent publications that are widely read are John Murphy’s Technical Analysis of the
			Financial Markets and Jack Schwager’s Schwager on Futures: Technical Analysis, part
			of a two-volume set.
		</p>
		<h2>
			The Dow Theory
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Dow Theory10 is still the foundation of chart interpretation and applies equally to
			stocks, financial markets, commodities, and the wide variety of investment vehicles used
			to trade them. It is part investor psychology supported by chart analysis. It is impressive
			that it has withstood the tests of more than 100 years. Charles Dow was the fi rst to create
			an index of similar stocks—the Industrials and the Railroads, although today’s components are 
			very different from those in 1897. The purpose of the index was to smooth out
			erratic price movement and fi nd consistency by combining less active stocks. Thin trading causes 
			unreliable price patterns.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dow’s work can be viewed in two parts: his theory of price movement, and his
			method of implementation. Both are inseparable to its success. Dow determined that
			the stock market moved as the ocean, in three waves, called primary, secondary, and
			daily fluctuations. The major advances and declines, lasting for extended periods,
			were compared to the tides. These tides were subject to secondary reactions called
			waves, and the waves were comprised of ripples. Readers familiar with other charting
			methods will recognize these patterns as the foundation of Elliott Wave analysis. In
			1897, Dow published two sets of averages in the Wall Street Journal, the Industrials
			and the Railroads in order to advance his ideas. These are now the Dow Jones Industrial 
			Average and the Transportation Index. Figure 3.1 shows more than 20 years of
			history for the three most important averages the Industrials, the Transportation, and
			the Utilities.

		<h2>
			The Basic Tenets of the Dow Theory
		</h2>
		<p>
			There are six fundamental principles of the Dow Theory that fully explain its operation.
		</p>
		<h2>
			1. The Averages Discount Everything (except “acts of God”)
		</h2>
		<p>
			At the turn of the twentieth century there was considerably less liquidity and regulation
			in the market; therefore, manipulation was common. By creating averages, Dow could reduce 
			the frequency of “unusual” moves in a single stock, that is, those moves that seemed
			unreasonably large or out of character with the rest of the market. Dow’s Industrials
			average the share value of 30 companies (adjusted for splits); therefore, an odd move in
			one of those prices would only be 1
			30 of the total, reducing its importance so that it would
			not distort the results. The average also represented far greater combined liquidity than
			a single stock. The only large moves that would appear on a chart of the average price
			were price shocks, or “acts of God.”
		</p>
		<h2>
			2. Classifications of Trends
		</h2>
		<p>
			There are three classifi cations of trends: primary trends, secondary swings, and minor
			day-to-day fl uctuations. The primary trend, also called the wave, is the trend on a grand
			scale. When there is a wave of rising prices we have a bull market; when prices are declining 
			there is a bear market. A wave is a major move over an extended period of time,
			generally measured in years. A clear bull market can be seen in the previous Dow charts
			(Figure 3.1) throughout all of the 1990s ending at the beginning of 2000, and again from
			2003 through mid-2007.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Bull and Bear Market Formation (for Monthly or Weekly Prices)
		</h2>
		<p>
			The beginning of a bull or bear market is determined using a breakout signal, shown in
			Figure 3.2, based on large swings in the index value (a complete explanation of breakout
			signals can be found in Chapter 5). The bull market signal occurs at the point where
			prices confirm the uptrend by moving above the high of the previous rally. The bear market 
			signal occurs on a break below the low of the previous decline.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is commonly accepted that a bull or bear market begins when prices reverse 20%
			from their lows or highs. In order to get an upwards breakout signal needed for a new
			bull market, we want to look at support and resistance levels (the previous intermediate
			high and low prices) separated by approximately a 10% price move based on the index
			value. This type of signal is called swing trading. At the top of Figure 3.2 the horizontal
			broken line should occur at about 20% below the absolute price highs, and the second
			peak should be approximately 10% higher than the previous swing low.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is interesting to note that both bull and bear markets start with a price reversal of
			20%. But 20% from the highs can be much greater than 20% from the lows. For example, in
			the sell-off in September 2008, the S&P was measured from its high of about 14,000 in late 
			2007. A decline to 11,200, or 2,800 points, triggered the bear market. In the first quarter of
			2009, the S&P reached its lows of about 6,500. A new bull market began at 7,800, a rally
			of only 1,300 points. Thus the number of points needed to “offi cially” start a bull market
			was only 46% of the bear market trigger, showing a signifi cant bias toward bull markets.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Bull and Bear Market Phases
		</h2>
		<p>
			In Dow Theory, the primary trends develop in three distinct phases, each characterized
			by investor action. These phases can be seen in the NASDAQ bull market of the late 1990s
			and the subsequent bear market (Figure 3.3).
		</p>
		<h3>
			The Bull Market
		</h3>
		<p>
			Phase 1: Accumulation. Cautious investors select only the safest and best-valued
			stocks to buy. They limit purchases to deeply discounted stocks at depressed price
			levels and consider only primary services and industries, most often buying utilities
			and high yielding stocks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase 2: Increasing volume. Greater investor participation causes increasing volume, 
			rising prices, and an improving economic picture. A broader range of investors
			enters the market convinced that the market has seen its lowest prices. Secondary
			stocks become popular.
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase 3: Final explosive move. Excessive speculation and an elated general population 
			result in a final explosive move. Everyone is talking about the stock market;
			people who have never considered investing directly now enter the market. The
			public is convinced that profi ts will continue and buying becomes indiscriminate.
			Investors borrow to buy stocks. Value is unimportant because prices keep rising.
			Earnings and dividends are ignored.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The Bear Market
		</h3>
		<p>
			Phase 1: Distribution. Professionals begin selling while the public is in the final
			stages of buying. Stocks are distributed from stronger to weaker hands. The change
			of ownership is facilitated by less experienced investors who enter the bull market
			too late and pay what turn out to be unreasonably high prices.
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase 2: Panic. Prices decline faster than at any time during the bull market and
			fail to rally. The news constantly talks about the end of the bull market. The public
			sees an urgency to liquidate. Investors who borrowed money to invest late in the bull
			market, trading on margin or leverage, now speed up the process. Some are forced
			to liquidate because their portfolio value has dropped below the critical point. The
			divesting of stocks takes on a sense of panic.
		</p>
		<p>
			Phase 3: Lack of buying interest. The fi nal phase in the sustained erosion of
			prices results from the lack of buying by the public. After taking losses, investors
			are not interested in buying even the strongest companies at extremely undervalued prices. 
			All news is viewed as negative. Pessimism prevails. It is the summer
			of 2002.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Schabacker’s Rules
		</h3>
		<p>
			Schabacker also had a simple guideline to identify the end of both a bull and a bear market.
		</p>
		<p>
			End of a Bull Market
			<ol>
				<li>Trading volume increases sharply.</li>
				<li>Popular stocks advance signifi cantly while some other companies collapse.</li>
				<li>Interest rates are high.</li>
				<li>Stocks become a popular topic of conversation.</li>
				<li>Warnings about an overheated stock market appear on the news.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			End of a Bear Market
			<ol>
				<li>Trading volume is low.</li>
				<li>Commodity prices have declined.</li>
				<li>Interest rates have declined.</li>
				<li>Corporate earnings are low.</li>
				<li>Stock prices have been steadily declining and bad news is everywhere.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Secondary Trends (Secondary Reactions Using Weekly or Daily Prices)
		</h3>
		<p>
			Secondary reactions are also called corrections or recoveries and can be identifi ed using
			smaller swing values. Corrections in bull markets are attributed to the prudent investor
			taking profi ts. This profi t phase can have an erratic start but is considered complete when
			prices rise above the previous secondary rally. The bull market is back in force when a
			new high occurs (see Figure 3.4), the point where a trader can enter a new long position.
			Lines may be substituted for secondary movements. In Dow Theory, a line is a sideways
			movement lasting from two to three weeks to months, trading in about a 5% range.
		</p>
		<p>
			Characteristics of a Secondary Reaction
			<ul>
				<li>There are a number of clear downswings.</li>
				<li>The movement is more rapid in the reversal (down during a bull market) than in the
					primary move</li>
				<li>The reactions last from three weeks to three months.</li>
				<li>If the volume during the price drop is equal to or greater than the volume just prior
					to the decline, then a bear market is likely. If volume declines during the drop, then a
					reaction is confi rmed.</li>
				<li>The atmosphere surrounding the decline is important. If there is a lot of speculation,
					then a bear market may develop.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Minor Trends (Using Daily Prices)</h3>
		<p>
			In Dow Theory, minor trends are the only trends that can be manipulated. They are usually under 
			six days in duration. Because they are considered market noise, not affecting
			the major price direction, they are seen as frequent up and down movements.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/dow-today.png" alt="reaction" width="100%">
		<h3>
			3. The Principle of Confi rmation
		</h3>
		<p>
			For a bull or bear market to exist, two of the three major averages (the Industrials, the
			Transportation, and the Utilities) must confi rm the direction. When first created, the Dow
			Theory required the confi rmation on only the Utilities and the Railroads. Although much
			has changed since Dow devised this rule, the purpose is to assure that the bull or bear
			market is a widespread economic phenomenon and not a narrower industry-related event.
		</p>
		<h3>
			4. Volume Goes with the Trend
		</h3>
		<p>
			Volume confirms the price move. Volume must increase as the trend develops, whether
			it is a bull or bear market. It is greatest at the peak of a bull market or during the panic
			phase of a bear market.
		</p>
		<h3>
			5. Only Closing Prices Are Used
		</h3>
		<p>
			Dow had a strong belief that the closing price each day was the most important price. It
			was the point of evening-up. Not only do day traders liquidate all of their positions before
			the close of trading, reversing their earlier impact, but many investors and hedge funds
			execute at the close. Although liquidity was a problem during Dow’s time, even actively
			traded stocks in today’s market show increased price swings when a larger order is executed 
			during a quiet period. There is always high volume at the close of trading, when
			investors with short and long time frames come together to decide the fair price.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some traders believe that there is no closing price anymore, given the access to 24-hour
			trading; however, that is not yet true. Every market has a settlement price. This is usually at
			the end of the primary trading session (previously the pit or open outcry session). The settlement 
			price is necessary to reconcile all accounts, post profi ts and losses, and trigger needed
			margin calls. Banks could not operate without an offi cial closing time and settlement price.
		</p>
		<h3>
			6. The Trend Persists
		</h3>
		<p>
			A trend should be assumed to continue in effect until its reversal has been signaled.
			This rule forms the basis of all trend-following principles. It considers the trend as a longterm 
			price move, and positions are entered only in the trend direction. The Dow Theory
			does not express expectations of how long a trend will continue. It simply follows the
			trend until a signal occurs that indicates a change of direction.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Interpreting Today’s S&P Using Dow Theory
		</h3>
		<p>
			After 110 years, can the Dow Theory correctly interpret the major market index, the S&P?
			Figure 3.5 shows the S&P 500, using continuous, back-adjusted futures prices, from 1994
			through the middle of 2003. The sustained bull market that began in 1987, or possibly
			1984, peaks near the end of the fi rst quarter of 2002. There is a steady increase in volume,
			as Dow had foreseen, although volume does not peak at the top of the market—it starts
			to decline noticeably about three months before the top. We will see in the study of volume 
			that volume spikes occur at extremes, but a longer-term volume confi rmation is very
			important. Declining volume at the beginning of 2003 signals a divergence in sentiment 
			that foretells the end of the bull market. Volatility increases as prices move towards the
			end of the uptrend, another predictable pattern. The price move from 1994 through the
			peak in 2002 shows both Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the bull market.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/dow-today.png" alt="dow theory todays context" width="100%">
		<p>
			The price decline in the third quarter of 1998 addresses the issue: Are there exceptions to 
			the 20% rule that changes a bull market to a bear market? A 20% drop from a high
			of 1400 is 1120, very close to the point where prices stopped their decline and reversed.
			Dow never used the number 20%, and analysts would claim that, because of the speed of
			the decline and the quick recovery, this was not a bear market signal. Some of these decisions 
			require judgment, some experience, and just a little bit of hindsight. Realistically,
			we cannot expect every Dow signal to always be correct, just as we cannot expect to be
			profitable on every trade. Long-term success is the real goal.
		</p>
		<h3>Transition from Bull to Bear in the S&P</h3>
		<p>
			Looking again for a 20% reversal from the S&P highs of 1675, we target the price of 1340.
			This time, volume has declined into the highs and continues to decline quickly. From the
			second quarter of 2000 through the fi rst quarter of 2001 prices fall sharply, giving back the
			gains from mid-1997, nearly three years. When prices break below 1300 they confirm the
			previous low at the end of 2000, making it clear that a bear market is underway.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the subsequent decline, prices attempted to rally. There are four cases of a
			sharp “V” bottom followed by a significant move higher. After the low at 940 at the end
			of September 2001, prices move to about 1180, above the 20% reversal of 1128. However,
			after the fi rst reversal to 1075 prices fail to move back above the highs, finally breaking
			below 1180 and continuing on to make new lows. Although the recovery exceeded 20%,
			the lack of a confirming breakout can be interpreted as a bull market failure. Not every
			pattern falls neatly into a rule.
		</p>
		<p>
			We come to the last year of the S&P chart, where prices have resisted going below 850,
			and now appear to be moving above the level of 970 and about to confi rm a bullish breakout. 
			Is it the end of the bear market? Volume was the highest at the two lowest price spikes,
			and then declined. Many stocks are undervalued, according to experts, yet those same
			experts see no reason for the market to rally further because the recent rise has already
			refl ected reasonable expectations for profits and growth in the next year. Who would be
			correct, Charles Dow or the talking heads of the financial news networks? It was Dow.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Dow Theory and Futures Markets
		</h3>
		<p>
			The principles of the Dow Theory are simple to understand. Major price moves are most
			important when they are confi rmed by volume. They follow a pattern created by investor
			action that seems to be universal when seen from a distance. In order to implement his
			theory, Dow created an index that minimized the erratic moves in individual stocks due
			to lack of liquidity and price manipulation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The primary features of the Dow Theory should hold for any highly liquid, actively
			traded market. This applies to index futures and most fi nancial futures markets, as well
			as foreign exchange, which have enormous volume and reflect major economic trends.
			Because of the variety of products traded as futures and ETFs, an investor may be able
			to apply Dow’s principle of confi rmation using any two related fi nancial markets, such
			as the S&P Index, 10-year Treasury notes, or the U.S. dollar index, in the same way that
			the Industrials, Utilities, and Transportation indexes were used for stocks. A strong economic 
			trend often begins with interest rate policy and has a direct impact on the value of
			the currency, and a secondary effect on the stock market. Stock prices can be stimulated
			by lower rates or dampened by raising rates; therefore, confi rmation from these three
			sectors is reasonable. When trading in futures, the nearby contract (the one closest to
			delivery) is most often used; however, the total volume of all futures contracts traded for
			each market must be used rather than volume for a single contract.
