		<h2>Trendlines</h2>
		<p>
			The trendline determines the current direction of price movement, and often identifi es
			the specific point at which that direction will change. The trendline is the most popular
			and recognized tool of chart analysis. Most analysts will agree that the trend is your
			friend; that is, it is always safer to take a position in the direction of the trend.
			<ul>
				<li>An upwards trendline is drawn across the lowest prices in a rising market.</li>
				<li>A downwards trendline is drawn across the highest prices in a declining market.</li>
			</ul>
			Figure 3.7 shows a classic downwards trendline, A, drawn on a chart of Intel. It connects the 
			highest price of $22 with price peaks at 18.00, 16.75, and 16.15 before ending at
			15.50. When prices move through the trendline heading higher, the downtrend has been
			penetrated. This may end the downtrend or cause a new downtrend line to be drawn. In
			this case it was the end of the downtrend.
		</p>
		<h3>Redrawing Trendlines</h3>
		<p>
			Most trendlines are not as long-lived or clear as the downtrend in Intel, which was
			drawn after the fact. Instead, we will treat the uptrend as it develops. The first uptrend 
			line, B, is drawn when the fi rst reversal shows a second low point. The upwards
			trendline B is drawn across the lows of points 1 and 2. Although prices do not decline
			through trendline B, rising prices pull back to points 3 and 4, well above the trendline.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/upward-and-downward.png" alt="upward and downward" width="100%">
		<p>
			At that point, we choose to redraw the upwards trendline connecting point 2 with 3
			and 4, forming what appears to be a stronger trendline. Trendlines are considered more
			important when they touch more points. However, prices move up quickly, and we decide to 
			redraw the trendline connecting points 4 and 5. It is very common to redraw
			trendlines as price patterns develop. Care must be taken to draw the lines in a way that
			touches the most points, although some chart analysts would draw a line that connects
			points 1 and 5, crossing through points 2, 3, and 4, because the fi nal picture seems to
			represent the dominant upwards price pattern. This can be seen as the broken line in
			Figure 3.7.
		</p>
		<h3>Support and Resistance Lines</h3>
		<p>
			Price movement creates patterns that refl ect the combined perception that all investors
			have of the current economic situation. Trends result from confidence or concern about
			the health of business or the supply and demand of a product. When there is no dominant
			opinion, prices move sideways in a price range determined by current volatility levels—
			sometimes wide, sometimes narrow. Because there are always buyers and sellers, prices
			do not stand still. Investment funds continue to add and withdraw money from the market.
		</p>
		<p>
			Periods of uncertainty form a sideways price pattern. The top of this pattern is called
			the resistance level, and the bottom is the support level. Once established, the support
			and resistance levels become key to identifying whether a trend is still in force.
		</p>
		<p>
			A horizontal support line is drawn horizontally to the right of the lowest price in a
			sideways pattern. It is best when drawn through two or more points and may cross above
			the lowest price if it makes the pattern clear. It represents a fi rm price level that has 
			withheld market penetration (or allowed minor penetration). It may be the most significant
			of all chart lines. In the chart of gold futures prices (Figure 3.8), the support line is drawn
			across the bottom of a sideways period, beginning at the fi rst low price on the left but
			crossing slightly above the next lowest point. The support line could have been drawn
			at $280.50 to include the first cluster of low prices and crossing above the lows bars but
			representing a clear support level.
		</p>
		<p>
			A horizontal resistance line serves the same purpose as the support line and is drawn
			across the highest highs of the sideways interval. It represents the price that has resisted
			upwards movement. Resistance lines are not normally as clear as support lines because
			they are associated with higher volatility and erratic price movement. In Figure 3.8 there
			are two choices for the horizontal resistance line. The most common selection would
			be the line that begins at top 1 and crosses below the high of top 2. In the same spirit as the
			support line, a resistance line could have been drawn much lower, beginning at top 3 and
			crossing above a cluster of highs while penetrating through the bars with tops 1 and 2.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Note the Position of the Closing Price of the Bar
		</h3>
		<p>
			A price bar that has the high price penetrating upwards through resistance but closes
			lower is considered a failed breakout and confi rms the sideways pattern. The same is
			true for a failed penetration of the support level. You may choose to raise the resistance
			line to the high of that failed bar, but most chartists ignore it, keeping the resistance line
			at its original position. Then we can expect to see a number of high prices penetrate
			through the resistance lines as shown by the breakout 2 line in Figure 3.8.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Resistance Becomes Support, and Support Becomes Resistance
		</h3>
		<p>
			Horizontal support and resistance lines are strong indicators of change. If prices are moving
			sideways because investors are unsure of direction, then a move through either support or
			resistance is usually associated with new information that causes investors to act. Whatever
			the cause, the market interprets this as a new event. Having moved out of the sideways pattern, 
			prices have a tendency to remain above resistance to confirm the change. If prices have
			moved higher, then the resistance line becomes a support line. If prices fall below the resistance line, 
			the price move is considered a failed breakout. In the right part of Figure 3.8, prices
			break out above the resistance levels and then come back to test those levels. In this example, prices 
			seem to confirm that the breakout 2 line was the more realistic resistance line.
		</p>
		<h3>
			A Trendline Is a Support or Resistance Line
		</h3>
		<p>
			The angled trendlines in Figure 3.7 are also called support and resistance lines. An upwards trendline, 
			drawn across the lows, is a bullish support line because it defines the lowest price allowed in order to 
			maintain the upwards trend. The downward trendline,
			drawn across the highs, is a bearish resistance line. These angled trendlines are most
			reliable when used to identify major price trends. Horizontal lines work well for shorter
			time frames.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Back-Adjusted Data
		</h3>
		<p>
			All traders use online services to display charts. They can draw support and resistance lines
			using various tools supplied by the service and can convert daily data to weekly or monthly
			with a single click. When looking at prices that go back many years, the analyst must be
			sure that the older data is not back-adjusted in any way. For example, futures trade in contracts 
			of limited maturity, and are most liquid during the last few months before expiration.
			Long-term charts put contracts together by back-adjusting the prices, so that the older data
			does not give the actual price at that time, but is altered by accumulated roll difference.
			Using those older prices as a guide for support or resistance doesn’t make any sense.
		</p>
		<p>
			This same problem exists for stocks that have split. The old price that you see on
			the chart may not be the actual price traded at that time. Floor traders are good at remembering 
			the last major high or low and will trade against those prices, or buy and sell
			breakouts. When plotting the support and resistance lines, look for the data option that
			creates a history of prices without back-adjusting.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Rules for Trading Using Trendlines
		</h3>
		<p>
			The simplest formations to recognize are the most commonly used and most important:
			horizontal support and resistance lines, bullish and bearish support and resistance lines,
			and channels created using those lines. Proper use of these basic lines is essential for
			identifying the overall direction of the market and understanding the patterns formed
			as prices move from one level to another. Many traders will generate their buy and sell
			orders directly from their chart analysis. Other, more computer-oriented analysts have
			automated the more important trendlines, particularly horizontal support and resistance,
			which has become the basic breakout system. Major chart patterns create the underlying
			profitability of chart trading; the more complex formations, as we will discuss further,
			may enhance good performance but rarely compensate for losses resulting from being
			on the wrong side of the trend.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the support and resistance lines have been drawn, a price penetration of those
			lines creates the basic trend signal (Figure 3.9). The bullish support line defines the 
			upward trend, and the bearish resistance line denotes the downward one. For long-term
			charts and major trends, this is often suffi cient. Some traders add the additional rule that
			once the price has penetrated a trendline, it must remain penetrated for some time period
			in order to confi rm the new trend. Most false penetrations correct quickly.
		</p>
		<h3>Confirming the New Trend Direction</h3>
		<p>
			In actual trading, the price crossing the trendline is not as clean as in Figure 3.8. Most
			often prices that have been moving higher will cross below the trendline, then recross
			moving higher, then move lower again. The trendline is an important turning point, and
			there may be indecision that is refl ected in a sideways price movement before prices
			reestablish a trend. To deal with this situation, traders may:
			<ul>
				<li>Wait a set time period to confi rm that prices remain on the new side of the trendline.</li>
				<li>Wait for a reversal after the penetration, then enter a trade in the new direction even
					if the reversal crosses the trendline again.</li>
				<li>Create a small safety zone (called a band or channel) around the trendline and enter
					the new trade if prices move through the trendline and through the safety zone.</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/basic-sell-and-buy.png" alt="buy and sell trendlines" width="100%">
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of these techniques requires a delay before entering. A delay normally benefits
			the trader by giving a better entry price; however, if prices fall quickly through an upwards 
			trendline and do not reverse or slow down, then any delay will result in a much
			worse entry price. Unfortunately, most of the biggest profits result from breakouts that
			never pull back. Catching only one of these breakouts can compensate for all the small
			losses due to false signals. Many professional traders wait for a better entry price. They
			may be steady winners, but they do not often profit from the biggest moves.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Trading Rules for Horizontal Support and Resistance Levels
		</h3>
		<p>
			As with angled trendlines, horizontal support and resistance lines show clear points for
			buying and selling. Also similar to angled trendlines, the horizontal lines become increasingly 
			important when longer time intervals and more points are used to form the lines.
			The technique for entering trades using horizontal lines is similar to that using angled
			trendlines; however, the maximum risk of the trade is clearly defined.
			<ul>
				<li>Buy when prices move above the horizontal resistance line</li>
				<li>Sell when prices move below the horizontal support line</li>
			</ul>
			<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/trading-rules-horizontal-sr-lines.png" alt="trading rules for horizontal support and resistance lines" width="100%">
		</p>
		<p>
			Once a long position has been entered, it is not closed out until prices move below
			the support line. The maximum risk of the trade is the difference between the support
			and resistance lines. As prices move higher, each swing reversal forms a low from which
			a new horizontal support line is drawn. After the initial entry, single points are most often
			used to create the horizontal support and raise the level at which the trade will be closed
			out. Figure 3.10 shows the pattern of horizontal support and resistance lines as the trade
			develops. For a swing low to form, prices must reverse by more than some threshold
			number of points or percentage. Not every small reversal qualifies as a swing low.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the first pullback in Figure 3.10 shows prices crossing below the original
			resistance line. This is a common occurrence, but the original line no longer holds the
			importance it had before it was broken. While it should provide support for the pullback
			(a resistance, once broken, becomes a support), it is more important to record the bottom 
			of the new pullback as the support level. These new support levels need only one
			price point. After the third support level is drawn, prices rally but then fall back through
			the third level, at which point the long position is closed out. A short position, if any, is
			not entered until a new sideways price pattern is established and horizontal support and
			resistance lines can be drawn across more than one point.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Identifying Direction from Consolidation Patterns
		</h3>
		<p>
			It is said that markets move sideways about 80% of the time, which means that sustained directional 
			breakouts do not occur often, or that most breakouts are false and fail
			to identify a new market direction. Classic accumulation and distribution formations,
			which occur at long-term lows and highs, attempt to fi nd evolving changes in market
			sentiment. Because these formations occur only at extremes, and may extend for a long
			time, they represent the most obvious consolidation of price movement. Even a rounded
			or saucer-shaped bottom may have a number of false starts; it may seem to turn up in a
			uniform pattern, then fall back and begin another slow move up. In the long run, the pattern looks 
			as if it is a somewhat irregular, extended rounded bottom; however, using this
			pattern to enter a trade in a timely fashion can be disappointing. It is easier to average in,
			where smaller positions are entered at fixed intervals as long as the developing formation
			remains intact.
		</p>
		<p>
			Most other consolidation formations are best viewed in the same way as a simple
			horizontal sideways pattern, bounded above by a resistance line and below by a support
			line. If this pattern occurs at reasonably low prices, we can eventually expect a breakout upwards 
			when the fundamentals change. Occasionally, prices seem to become less
			volatile within the sideways pattern, and chartists take this opportunity to redefi ne the
			support and resistance levels so that they are narrower. Breakouts based on these more
			sensitive lines tend to be less reliable because they represent a temporary quiet period
			inside the larger, normal level of market noise; however, there are two distinct camps,
			one that believes that breakouts are more reliable after a period of low volatility and the
			other that prefers breakouts associated with high volatility. Some of the situations are
			discussed in Chapter 20 under “VIX” and “Volatility System.”
		</p>
		<h3>
			Creating a Channel with Trendlines
		</h3>
		<p>
			A channel is formed by a trendline and another line drawn parallel to the trendline enclosing a 
			sustained price move. The purpose of the channel is to define the volatility of the price
			move and establish reasonable entry and exit points. Up to now, the trendline has only been
			used to identify the major price direction. A long position is entered when the price crosses
			a downward trendline moving higher. The trade is held until the price moves below the
			upwards trendline. However, it is more common to have a series of shorter trades. While
			the biggest profits come from holding one position throughout a sustained trend, a series
			of shorter trades each has far less risk and is preferred by the active trader. Be aware that
			trendlines using very little data are essentially analyzing noise and have limited value.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before a channel can be formed, the bullish or bearish trendline must be drawn. A
			clear uptrend line requires at least two, and preferably three or more major low points on
			the chart, as shown in Figure 3.11, where points 1, 2, and 3 are used. These points do not
			have to fall exactly on the line. Once the trendline is drawn, the highest high, point B, can
			be used to draw another line parallel to the upwards trendline. The area in between the
			two parallel lines is the channel.
		</p>
		<p>
			In theory, trading a channel is a simple process. We buy as prices approach the support line 
			(in this case the upwards trendline), and we sell as prices near the resistance
			line. These buy and sell zones should be approximately the bottom and top 20% of the
			channel. Because the channel line is used to determine price targets, you might choose
			to draw the broken line across point A. The use of point A creates a channel that is narrower 
			than the one formed using the higher point B and recognizes the variability of price
			movement. This allows you to take profi ts sooner.
		</p>
		<p>
			If prices continue through the lower trendline after a long position has been set,
			the trade is exited. The trend direction has changed, and a new bearish resistance line, 
			the downward trendline, needs to be drawn using points B and C, shown in Figure 3.12.
			Once the first pull-back occurs leaving a low at point 4, a parallel line is drawn crossing
			point 4, forming the downward channel. In a downward trending channel, it is best to
			sell short in the upper zone and cover the short in the lower zone. Buying in the lower
			zone is not recommended; trades are safest when they are entered in the direction of
			the trend.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/trading-price-channel.png" alt="Trading Price channel" width="100%">
		<p>
			When the support and resistance lines are relatively horizontal, or sideways, the channel is 
			called a trading range. There is no directional bias in a trading range; therefore, 
			you can enter new long positions in the support zone and enter new shorts in the sell
			zone. In both cases, penetration of either the support or resistance lines forces liquidation 
			of the trade and establishes a new trend direction.
