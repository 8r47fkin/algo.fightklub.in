		<h2>Implied Strategies in Candlestick Charts</h2>
		<p>
			For a technique that is reported to have been used as early as the mid-1600s, Japanese
			candle charts were slow to find their way into the western method of analysis. Candle
			charts can be related to bar charts but offer additional visual interpretation. The candles
			are created simply by shading the piece of the bar between the opening and closing prices: 
			white if the close is higher than the open and black if the close is lower than the open.
			The shaded area is called the body and the extended lines above and below the body are
			the shadows. With this simple change, we get an entirely new way of looking at and 
			interpreting charts. The patterns become much clearer than the Western style of line chart.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although many candlestick patterns have equivalent bar chart formations, there is
			an implied strategy in many of them. The following summary uses the traditional candlestick 
			names representing the significance of the formation (see Figure 3.38):
			<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/candlestick-formation.png" alt="candlestick-formation" width="100%">
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Doji, in which the opening and closing prices are the same. This represents indecision, 
				a temporary balancing point. It is neither bullish nor bearish. A double
				doji, where two dojis occur successively, implies that a significant breakout will
				follow.
			</li>
			<li>
				Engulfing patterns seem at first to be the same as outside days in bar charting, but
				the pattern only refers to the part of the bar between the opening and closing prices.
				Engulfing patterns are considered exceptionally strong signals of price change. A
				bullish engulfing pattern has a black candle followed by a white, indicating a wide
				range with a higher close. The bearish engulfing pattern is white followed by black,
				showing a lower close on the engulfi ng day.
			</li>
			<li>
				Morning star and evening star are 3-day patterns that show a similarity to an island
				reversal, but are more specific. In the morning star, a bullish reversal pattern, the
				first day has a lower close than the open, the second day (called the star, similar to
				the island bottom) has a higher close, and the final reversal day has an even higher
				close. The bearish reversal is just the opposite, with two higher closes followed by
				a reversal day with a lower close. If the star is also a doji, then the pattern has more
				significance.
			</li>
			<li>
				Piercing line and dark cloud cover are bullish and bearish reversals. The piercing
				line, a bullish reversal, begins with a black candle (a lower close) and is followed by a
				white candle in which the open is below the previous day’s low and the close is above
				the midpoint of the previous day’s body (the open-close range). The dark cloud cover
				is a bearish formation, the opposite of the piercing line.
			</li>
			<li>
				Hammer, a bullish reversal signal, showing the bottom of a swing, where the body is
				at the top of the candle, indicating an upwards change of direction, and the shadow
				is below the body. The body may be black or white.
			</li>
			<li>
				Hanging man, a bearish reversal pattern where the body of the candle represents
				the high of a swing, and the shadow lies below in the direction of the reversal. The
				body may be black or white.
			</li>
			<li>
				Shooting star, a bearish signal, also occurs at the top of a swing and has its body
				at the bottom of the candle with the shadow above. The body may be black or
				white.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Although these patterns are similar to Western bar chart formations, none of them
			are exactly the same. The hammer, hanging man, and shooting star are reversal patterns
			but can only be compared to the simple pivot point where the middle day is higher or
			lower than the bars on either side. None of these candle formations is exactly the same
			as a key reversal day or island reversal. The engulfi ng pattern is stronger than the typical
			outside day because the spanning of the prior day’s range must be done only by the current day’s open-close range.

			The analysis of candle charts is a skill involving the understanding of many complex
			and interrelated patterns. For full coverage, Steve Nison’s, Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, 
			second edition, is recommended, as well as a selection of newer books,
			which can be found on Amazon.

		<h3>
			Quantifying Candle Formations
		</h3>
		<p>
			The preciseness of the candle formations allow some patterns to be tested. The popular
			engulfing patterns can be defined exactly for a computer program as
			<code>
				Bullish engulfi ng pattern = Previous open > previous close and today’s
					open < previous close and today’s close > previous open

				Bearish engulfi ng pattern = Previous close > previous open and today’s
					open > previous close and today’s close < previous open
			</code>
			Another technique uses the shadows as confirmation of direction. We can interpret
			an increase in the size of the upper shadows as strengthening resistance (prices are closing lower each day); 
			an increase in the size of the lower shadows represents more support. One way to look at this is by defining
			<code>
				Upper shadow ( white) = high − close 			Lower shadow (white) = open − low
				Upper shadow (black) = high − open 				Lower shadow (black) = close − low
			</code>
			The sequences of upper and lower shadows can be smoothed separately using a
			moving average to find out whether they are rising or falling.
		</p>
		<p>
			A method for determining whether black or white candles dominate recent price
			movement is to use only the body of the candle, B = close − open, and apply a momentum
			calculation:
			<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/body-momentum.png" alt="body momentum formula">
			When the body momentum is greater than 70, the whites dominate; when the value is
			below 20 the blacks dominate. These thresholds indicate a built-in upwards bias.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Morning Star and Evening Star
		</h3>
		<p>
			Two formations that are easily programmed are the morning star (a bullish signal) and
			evening star (a bearish signal). Using the morning star as an example, the rules call for a
			long downward (black) candle followed by a lower (the open of the next bar less than the
			close of the previous long bar), less volatile white candle, and fi nally an upward thrust
			shown as a gap up body with the close higher than the open (another white candle).
		</p>
		<p>
			When programmed (see TSM Morning Star and TSM Evening Star in the
			Companion Website), there are very few signals when we put restriction on the size
			of the bodies of the three days. Instead, we only required that the body of the first
			day be greater than the 20-day average, the second day less, and the third day greater.
			While there are still only a modest number of trades, the S&P performs well on the day
			following both patterns.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Qstick
		</h3>
		<p>
			As a way of quantifying the Candle formations, Tuschar Chande19 created Qstick, a moving average 
			of the body of the candle. It is intended to be an aid interpreting the charts
			but has simple trading rules as well.
		<code>
			If Bodyt = Closet – Opent
		</code>
		and
		<code>
			Qt = average(period1,body), where period1 is suggested as 8 days
			AvgQt = average(period2,Q), where period2 is also 8 days
		</code>
		Then the trading rules are
		<code>
			Buy when Qt moves above AvgQt
			Sell when Qt moves below AvgQt
		</code>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Pivot Points and Candle Charts
		</h3>
		<p>
			John L. Person suggests that the strategies inherent in candle formations can be combined with support 
			and resistance levels derived from pivot points. He uses the following calculations:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Pivot point, P = (high + low + close)/3
				</li>
				<li>
					First resistance level, R1 = (P × 2) − low
				</li>
				<li>
					Second resistance level, R2 = P + high − low
				</li>
				<li>
					First support level, S1 = (P + 2) − high
				</li>
				<li>
					Second support level, S2 = P − high + low
				</li>
			</ol>
			Once a key formation for a top or bottom is recognized using candle charts, support
			and resistance levels calculated based on pivot points can be a strong indication of the
			extent of the following price move. Person used Dow futures to support his study.

		<h3>
			The Best of the Candles
		</h3>
		<p>
			Bulkowski has summarized his own research in the success of various candles as
			<ul>
				<li>
					The best-performing candles had closing prices within 1/3 of the bar low, followed by
					the middle and high, respectively.
				</li>
				<li>
					Candle patterns in a bear market outperform other markets, regardless of the breakout direction.
				</li>
				<li>
					Most candles perform best on days with higher volume.
				</li>
				<li>
					Candles with unusually long wicks outperform.
				</li>
				<li>
					Unusually tall candles outperform.
				</li>
			</ul>
