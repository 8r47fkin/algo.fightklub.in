		<h2>Accumulation and Distribution - Bottoms and Tops</h2>
		<p>
			Most of the effort in charting, and the largest payout in trading, goes into the identification
			of tops and bottoms. For long-term traders, those trying to take advantage of major bull
			and bear markets, these formations can unfold over fairly long periods. These prolonged
			phases, which represent the cyclic movement in the economy, are called accumulation
			when prices are low and investors slowly buy into their position, and distribution at the
			top, where the invested positions are sold off.
		</p>
		<p>
			The same formations can occur over shorter periods and are very popular among all
			traders; however, they are not as reliable. There are many top and bottom formations that
			are popular and easily recognized. In order of increasing complexity, they are the V-top
			or V-bottom, the double or triple top or bottom, the common rounded top or bottom, the
			broadening top or bottom, the head-and-shoulders formation, and the complex top or
			bottom.
		</p>
		<h3>
			V-Tops and V-Bottoms
		</h3>
		<p>
			The V-top (actually an inverted “V”), which may also have a spike on the final day, is the
			easiest pattern to see afterwards, but the most difficult top formation to anticipate and
			trade. There have been times, such as in 1974, 1980, and 2000, when the frequency of
			V-tops were deceiving. V-tops are preceded by critical shortage and demand, and magnified 
			by constant news coverage. In 1974, it was a combination of domestic crop shortage, severe 
			pressure on the U.S. dollar abroad, and foreign purchases of U.S. grain that
			combined to draw public attention to a potential shortage in wheat. The news was so
			well publicized that novice commodity traders withdrew their funds from their declining
			stock portfolios and bought any commodity available as a hedge against inflation.
		</p>
		<p>
			It could not continue for long. When the top came in soybeans, silver, and most other
			commodities, there was no trading for days in locked-limit markets; paper profits dwindled 
			faster than they were made, and the latecomers found their investments unrecoverable. The 
			public often seems to enter at the wrong time.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most dramatic of all price moves was the technology bubble of the 1990s, ending with a 
			peak in the NASDAQ index during March 2000. As you can see in Figure 3.21,
			prices rose faster near the end of the bull market, then collapsed just as quickly. It would
			have been reasonable to expect the move up to end any time after prices penetrated
			through 3,000, and difficult to expect them to reach 5,000.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recently, there have been runs in many commodities, but cotton stands out as exceptional. 
			Flooding in both Pakistan and Egypt has greatly reduced the supply causing prices
			to soar. Figure 3.22 shows prices in February 2011 at levels four times the normal price
			and a top has not yet formed. Normally, supply shortages in agricultural markets correct
			by the next season, but the current run has been so extensive that it may take more time
			to resolve. Inevitably, it will be solved in the same way, over one or two crop years.
		</p>

		<p>
			The psychology of the runaway market is fascinating. In some ways, every V-top
			shares a similarity with the examples in Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions
			and the Madness of Crowds. When beef is in short supply, the result of higher feed costs,
			the consumers do not tend to consider pork, fowl, or fish as an adequate substitute and
			will accept increased costs longer than expected. This is called inelastic demand. As
			prices near the top, the following changes occur:
			<ul>
				<li>The cost becomes an increasing factor in the standard household budget.</li>
				<li>Rising prices receive more publicity.</li>
				<li>Movements for public beef boycotts begin.</li>
				<li>Grain prices decline due to the new harvest.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			This becomes a matter explained by the Theory of Elasticity. It can be applied to
			the 1973 soybean, 1980 silver, and the recent cotton markets. The theory is based on the
			principle that when prices get high enough, four phenomena occur:
			<ul>
				<li>Previously higher-priced substitutes become practical (synthetics for cotton, reclaimed silver).</li>
				<li>Competition becomes more feasible (corn sweetener as a sugar substitute, alternate energy).</li>
				<li>Inactive operations start up (Southwest gold mines, marginal production of oil).</li>
				<li>Consumers avoid the products (beef, bacon, silver, cotton).</li>
			</ul>
			Consequently, the demand suddenly disappears (the same conclusion arrived at by economists).
		</p>
		<p>
			Announcements of additional production, more acreage, new products, boycotts,
			and a cancellation of orders all coming at once cause highly inflated prices to reverse
			sharply. These factors form a V-top that is impossible to anticipate with reasonable risk.
			There is a natural reluctance to cash in on profits while they are still increasing every
			day. The situation becomes even more perilous at the end of the move when more investors join 
			the party. These latecomers who entered their most recent positions near the
			top will show a loss immediately and will need to get out of the trade first; they cannot
			afford a continued adverse move. Once a reversal day is recognized, there is a mad rush
			to liquidate. The large number of investors and speculators trying to exit at the same time
			causes the sharpness in the V-top and extends the drop in prices. There is a liquidity void
			at many points during the decline where there are no buyers and a long line of sellers.
			A V-top or V-bottom is always accompanied by high volatility and usually high volume.
			When the V-top is particularly extreme, it is commonly called a blow-off. A true V-top or
			V-bottom will become an important medium- or long-term high or low for that market.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Two V-Tops in Amazon.com
		</h3>
		<p>
			There is a classic V-top in Amazon.com during January 1999, shown in Figure 3.23, and
			another potential, smaller formation in April. This second one looked as though it was a
			V-top for two days, then quickly disappeared into a broader formation of no particular pattern. 
			A V-top cannot be recognized after only a 1-day downturn. The fi nal peak seen in Amazon in 
			late April 1999 is broader than a classic V-top but could still be labeled the same.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/classic-v-top.png" alt="classic-v-top" width="100%">
		<p>
			When trading, you would expect rising prices to fail when they approach the level of
			a previous clear V-top, which forms significant resistance. In Figure 3.23, where prices 
			began the second V-top, declined for two days, rallied for the next three days, then dropped
			sharply for two days, we would normally expect a further decline. In this case, prices
			made another attempt to break the highs, succeeded, then collapsed. After the last peak,
			it will be necessary to wait until the price falls below the support level at $75 in order to
			confirm the downward break, having been fooled on the previous move.
		</p>
		<h3>
			V-Bottoms
		</h3>
		<p>
			V-bottoms are much less common than their upside counterparts. They occur more often
			in commodity markets where supply and demand can change dramatically and leverage
			causes surges of buying and selling. Both V-tops and V-bottoms should be read as a sign
			that prices have gone too far, too fast. Both buyers and sellers need time to reevaluate
			the fundamentals to decide where prices should be. V-bottoms are usually followed by a
			rebound and then a period of sideways movement. Two good examples can be found in
			the crude oil chart, Figure 3.24, and in the stock market crash of October 1987.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Double and Triple Tops and Bottoms
		</h3>
		<p>
			The experienced trader is most successful when prices are testing a major support or resistance level, 
			especially an all-time high in a stock or a contract or seasonal high or low in futures. The more often 
			those levels are tested, the clearer they become and the less
			likely prices will break through to a new level without additional fuel. This fuel comes in
			the form of higher earnings or a change in the fundamental supply and demand factors.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/two-v-tops.png" alt="two V-Tops" width="100%">
		<p>
			A double top is a price peak followed, a few days or weeks later, by another peak,
			and stopping very close to the same level. A double bottom, more common than a double
			top, occurs when two price valleys show lows at nearly the same level. Because prices
			are more likely to settle for a while at a lower price than a high one, prices often test a
			previous support level causing a double bottom.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tops and bottoms occur at the same level because traders believe that the same
			reason that caused prices to fail to go higher the first time will be the reason they fail the
			second time. The exceptionally high or low prices are the result of speculation rather
			than fundamentals. In the same way that some stocks will trade at price/earnings ratios
			far above any rational assessment of business prospects in the near future, commodity
			prices can be pushed to extremes by crowd psychology without regard to value. Traders,
			looking for a place to sell an unreasonably high price, target the previous point where
			prices failed. Although a classic double top is thought to peak at exactly the same price,
			selling in anticipation of the test of the top may cause the second peak to be lower than
			the first. Figure 3.25 shows one type of double top in crude oil. While some double tops
			are two sharp peaks, this one looks as though it was gathering energy. It penetrated
			slightly above the previous high, but could not sustain higher prices. Double tops are
			rarely perfect.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/double-top.png" alt="double-top" width="100%">
		<h3>
			Double Bottoms
		</h3>
		<p>
			Bottoms are more orderly than tops. They should be quiet rather than volatile. They are
			caused by prices reaching a level that is low enough for the normal investor to recognize
			that there is little additional downside potential. Economists might call this the point of
			equilibrium. Neither buyers nor sellers are convinced that prices will continue to move
			lower. They wait for further news.
		</p>
		<p>
			Double bottoms will often test the same price level because large-position traders
			and commercial users of commodities accumulate more physical inventory, or increase
			their futures position, each time the price falls to their target level. Once prices are low,
			there is less chance of absolute loss. Selling a double top can be very risky. The greatest
			risk when buying a double bottom is that your timing is wrong. If prices do not rally soon,
			you have used your capital poorly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cisco shows a double bottom in Figure 3.26, although it lacks the clear decline in volatility 
			that we would like to see, and which accompanies commodities when they reach a
			price level near the cost of production. The small spikes down show four attempts to go
			lower, followed by a faster move up. When prices cross above the highs formed between
			the two bottom patterns, we have a completion, or confi rmation, of the double bottom.
		</p>
		<p>
			Traders will start to buy a double bottom when prices slow near previous low levels.
			They will also look for declining volume or confi rmation in the stock price of another
			related company or a related sector ETF. Waiting for the breakout above the highs of the
			bottom formation is a safer signal for a conservative trader, but lost opportunity for a
			more active one.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/double-bottom.png" alt="double-bottom" width="100%">
		<h3>
			Triple Tops and Bottoms
		</h3>
		<p>
			Triple tops and triple bottoms are considerably less common than double tops and bottoms; however, 
			of the two, bottoms can be found more readily. Figure 3.27 shows a classic triple top in natural gas. 
			A triple top can be formed from a V-top, but in this case, the
			first peak is an island reversal, the second is a spike, and the third an extended top that
			ends the move.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we did not have the advantage of seeing the triple top afterwards, each of the individual tops 
			would look as if it were the end of the move. After the first island reversal
			prices dropped $2; after the second peak there was another large gap down and a 1-day
			loss of more than $1. High volatility is normally associated with an extreme top. By waiting for a 
			confirmation of a decline after the single or double top, the trade would have
			been entered $1.50 to $2.50 below the top, and that position would be held while prices
			reversed to test the highs. Selling tops is risky business.
		</p>
		<p>
			A triple bottom that can be traded is most likely to occur at low prices and low volatility, much 
			the same as a double bottom. They show an inability to go lower because
			investors are willing to accumulate a position at a good value. For commodities, it is a
			good place for a processor to accumulate inventory.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The Danger of Trading Double and Triple Tops
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are many examples of double tops and a smaller number of triple tops. Ideally, there is a 
			lot of money to be made by selling tops at the right place. However, the likelihood of this good 
			fortune happening is less than it appears. Consider why a triple
			top is so rare. It is because prices continue higher and the potential triple top disappears
			into a strong bull market pattern.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/classic-triple-top.png" alt="classic-triple-top" width="100%">
		<p>
			This happens even more often with double tops. Every time a price pulls back from
			new highs, then starts moving up again, there is a potential double top. In a prolonged
			bull market, many double tops disappear in the move higher. Selection of the double
			top becomes important. This is done using volume, volatility, support, and resistance,
			and sometimes common sense. These confirming indicators are discussed throughout
			this book. Until then, it is important to recognize the difficulty of deciding whether the
			current pattern will be a single, double, or triple top, or simply a pause in a bull market.
			Although we would all like to be a seller at the highs, these tops are best sold after they
			are confirmed, that is, after a decline proves that the top has occurred. Even then, a new
			high should cause a fast exit from the trade.
		</p>
		<p>
			As with other chart patterns, declining volume would be a welcome confirmation
			after the formation of the first top and would accompany each additional test of the top.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Extended Rectangle Bottom
		</h3>
		<p>
			Many of the important chart formations can be traded using a penetration of one of the
			support or resistance lines as a signal. Those with the most potential profi tability occur
			on breakouts from major top or bottom formations. The simplest of all bottom formations, as 
			well as one that offers great opportunities, is the extended rectangle at longterm low price levels. 
			Fortunes have been made by applying patience, some available
			capital, and the following plan:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Find a market with a long consolidating base and low volatility. In July 2002
					Amazon.com reaches a low with volatility declining. In futures, crude oil remained at
					low prices for 13 years, as seen in Figure 3.28. The bottom can be confi rmed by a decrease 
					in the open interest. When evaluating interest rates, consider using the yield
					rather than the price.
				</li>
				<li>
					Buy whenever there is a test of its major support level, placing a stop-loss to
					liquidate all positions on a new low price. Increasing volume should confi rm the
					buying, and with futures markets the upside breakout should be accompanied by
					increasing open interest. For crude oil, the resistance was between $21 and $22
					because OPEC had set its OGSP (Offi cial Government Selling Price) between $18
					and $22.
				</li>
				<li>
					After the initial breakout, buy again when prices pull back to the original resistance
					line (now a support level). Crude rallied from the lows to just under $40 before pulling 
					back to the old resistance level at $19. Close out all positions if prices penetrate
					back into the consolidation area and start again at Step 2.
				</li>
				<li>
					Buy whenever there is a major price correction in the bull move. These adjustments,
					or pullbacks, will become shorter and less frequent as the move develops. They will usually 
					be proportional to current volatility or the extent of the price move as measured from the original breakout.
				</li>
				<li>
					Liquidate all positions at a prior major resistance point, a top formation, or the breaking of a major bullish support line.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Building positions in this way can be done with a relatively small amount of capital
			and risk. The closer the price comes to major support, the shorter the distance from the
			stop-loss; however, fewer positions can be placed. In his book The Professional Commodity Trader, 
			Stanley Kroll discussed “The Copper Caper—How We’re Going to Make
			a Million,” using a similar technique for building positions. It can be done, but it requires
			patience, planning, and capital. The opportunities continue to be there.
		</p>
		<p>
			This example of patiently building a large position does not usually apply to bear
			markets. Although there is a great deal of money to be made on the short side of the
			market, prices move faster and may not permit the accumulation of a large position.
			There can also be exceptionally high risk caused by greater volatility. The only pattern
			that allows for the accumulation of a large short position is the rounded top, discussed
			in the next section. Within consolidation areas for commodities at low levels, there are a
			number of factors working in your favor: the underlying demand for a product, the cost
			of production, government price support (for agricultural products), and low volatility
			itself. There is also a clear support level that may have been tested many times. A careful
			position trader will not enter a large short-sale position at an anticipated top when volatility 
			is high, but instead will join the buyers who contribute to the growing volume and
			open interest at a well-defi ned major support level.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Rounded Tops and Bottoms
		</h3>
		<p>
			When prices change direction over a longer time period they can create a rounded top or
			bottom pattern. A rounded top reflects a gradual change in market forces from buyers to
			sellers. In the stock market it is also called distribution. It is a clear sign that any attempt
			to move prices higher has been abandoned. Rounded tops often lead to faster and faster
			price drops as more investors liquidate their long positions or initiate shorts.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Figure 3.29 we see two classic rounded tops in the German DAX stock index. The
			first is an example of gathering downside momentum as more investors become aware of
			the decline. Prices drop faster after a break of the double bottom. The rounded top offers
			a rare opportunity to accumulate a short position with relatively low volatility.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Rounded Bottom
		</h3>
		<p>
			A rounded bottom, similar to a rounded top, is an extended formation where prices gradually turn 
			from down to up. In Figure 3.30 we see a rounded bottom in the Japanese yen
			followed by a breakaway gap. Similar to the extended rectangle, the rounded bottom
			offers traders an opportunity to accumulate a large long position. In this case, the sharp
			rally as prices move through the high of the rounded bottom, followed by a runaway
			gap, clearly marks the end of the rounded bottom. The breakout can be interpreted as a
			change in the supply and demand balance. A breakout, whether in stocks or futures, indicates 
			that something new has entered the picture.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/two-rounded-tops.png" alt="two rounded tops" width="100%">
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/rounded-bottom.png" alt="rounded bottoms" width="100%">
		<h3>
			Wedge Top and Bottom Patterns
		</h3>
		<p>
			We have seen a wedge formation as a continuation pattern in Figure 3.20, but a large
			ascending wedge can mark the top of a move and a large descending wedge the bottom.
			The dominant characteristic of the wedge is that volatility is declining towards the end.
			In Figure 3.31 there is a declining wedge in the Japanese yen. Volatility compresses until
			a breakout is inevitable. If the breakout had been to the downside, this wedge would have
			been interpreted as a continuation pattern. In this example, a breakout in the opposite
			direction is a strong indicator of a major reversal.
		</p>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/declining-wedge.png" alt="declining-wedge" width="100%">
		<h3>
			Head-and-Shoulders Formation
		</h3>
		<p>
			The classic top and bottom formation is the head and shoulders, accepted as a major reversal indicator. 
			This pattern, well known to chartists, appears as a left shoulder, a head,
			and a right shoulder, seen in Figure 3.32. The head-and-shoulders top is developed with
			the following five characteristics:
			<ol>
				<li>
					A strong upward breakout reaching new highs on increasing volume. The pattern
					appears to be the continuation of a long-term bull move.
				</li>
				<li>
					A consolidation area formed with declining volume. This can look much like a 
					descending flag predicting an upwards breakout, or a descending triangle indicating a
					downwards breakout.
				</li>
				<li>
					Another upwards breakout on continued reduced volume forms the head. This is the
					key point of the formation. The new high is not confi rmed by increased volume, and
					prices drop quickly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Another descending flag or triangle is formed on further reduced volume, followed
					by a minor breakout without increased volume. This last move forms the right shoulder 
					and is the third attempt at new highs for the move.
				</li>
				<li>
					The lowest points of the two flags, pennants, or triangles become the neckline of the
					formation. A short sale is indicated when this neckline is broken.
				</li>
			</ol>
		<img src="/api/en/tsm/charting/head-and-shoulders.png" alt="head-and-shoulders" width="100%">
		</p>
		<h3>
			Trading Rules for Head and Shoulders
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are three approaches to trading a head-and-shoulders top formation involving increasing degrees of anticipation:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Wait for a confi rmation.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Sell when the fi nal dip of the right shoulder penetrates the neckline. This represents the completion 
							of the head-and-shoulders formation. Place a stop-loss just
							above the entry if the trade is to be held only for a fast profi t, or place the stop-loss
							above the right shoulder or above the head in order to liquidate on new strength,
							allowing a longer holding period.
						</li>
						<li>
							Sell on the fi rst rally after the neckline is broken. (Although more conservative,
							the lost opportunities may outweigh the improved entry prices.) Use the same
							stops as in Step la.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Anticipation of the final shoulder
					<ul>
						<li>
							Sell when the right shoulder is being formed. A likely place would be when prices
							have retraced their way half the distance to the head. A stop-loss can be placed
							above the top of the head.
						</li>
						<li>
							Wait until the top of the right shoulder is formed and prices appear to be declining.
							Sell and place a stop either above the high of the right shoulder or above the high
							of the head.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Both steps 2a and 2b allow positions to be taken well in advance of the neckline
						penetration with logical stop-loss points. Using the high of the head for a protective
						stop is considered a conservative approach because it allows the integrity of the pattern 
						to be tested before the position is exited.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Early anticipation of the head.
					<p>
						Sell when the right part of the head is forming, on the downwards price move, with a
						stop-loss at about the high of the move. Although this represents a small risk, it has
						less chance of success. This approach is for traders who prefer to anticipate tops and
						are willing to suffer frequent small losses to do it. Even if the current prices become
						the head of the formation, there may be numerous small corrections that will look
						like the market top to an anxious seller.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			Volume was a recognized part of the classic definition of the head-and-shoulders
			formation and appeared in Robert D. Edwards and John Magee’s Technical Analysis
			of Stock Trends, published in 1948. This is no longer considered as important. There
			are many examples of successful head-and-shoulders formations that do not satisfy the
			volume criterion. Nevertheless, declining volume on the head or the right shoulder of a
			top formation must be seen as a strong confirmation of a failing upwards move, and is
			consistent with the normal interpretation of volume.
