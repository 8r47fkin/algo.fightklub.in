		<h2>Basic Concepts in Chart Trading</h2>
		<p>
			Having covered the fundamental chart patterns, there are some additional concepts that
			should be discussed in order to keep the proper perspective. Charting involves a great
			deal of subjective pattern identification; therefore, there may be a choice of patterns
			within the same time interval. There are also many cases where prices nearly form a pattern, 
			but the shape does not fi t perfectly into the classic definition.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Major and Minor Formations
		</h3>
		<p>
			In the study of charting, the same patterns will appear in short- as well as long-term
			charts. An upwards trendline can be drawn across the bottom of a price move that only
			began last week, or it can identify a sustained 3-year trend in the financial markets, or a
			6-month move in Amazon.com. In general, formations that occur over longer time intervals 
			are more significant. All-time highs and lows, well-defined trading ranges, trendlines
			based on weekly charts, and head-and-shoulder formations are carefully watched by
			traders. Obscure patterns and new formations are not of interest to most chartists, and
			cannot be resolved consistently unless traders buy and sell at the right points. Charting
			is most successful when formations are easy to see; therefore, the most obvious buy and
			sell points are likely to attract a large number of orders.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Market Noise
		</h3>
		<p>
			All markets have a normal level of noise. The stock index markets have the greatest
			amount of irregular movement due their extensive participation, the high level of anticipation 
			built into the prices, the uncertain way in which economic reports and news will
			impact prices, and because it is an index. This is contrasted to short-term interest rates,
			such as Eurodollars, which have large participation but little anticipation because it has
			strong ties to the underlying cash market, governed by the central bank. The normal level
			of noise can be seen in the consistency of the daily or weekly trading range on a chart of
			the Dow or S&P. When volatility declines below the normal level of noise, the market is
			experiencing short-term inactivity. An increase in volatility back to normal levels of noise
			should not be confused with a breakout.
		</p>
		<p>
			This same situation can be applied to a triangular formation, which has traditionally
			been interpreted as a consolidation, or a pause, within a trend. This pattern often follows
			a fast price change and represents a short period of declining volatility. If volatility declines 
			in a consistent fashion, it appears as a triangle; however, if the point of the triangle
			is smaller than the normal level of market noise, then a breakout from this point is likely
			to restore price movement to a range typical of noise, resulting in a flag or pennant formation. 
			Both of these latter patterns have uniform height that can include a normal level
			of noise, but they would not be reliable signals.
