		<h2>Episodic Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			There is little argument that all prices change quickly in response to unexpected news.
			The transition from one major level to another is termed an episodic pattern; when these
			transitions are violent, they are called price shocks. Until the late 1990s, there were very
			few price shocks in the stock market, the greatest being the one resulting from the terrorist 
			attacks of September 11, 2001. Otherwise, price shocks can be caused by a surprising election 
			result, the unexpected raising of interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the
			devaluation of a currency by an important Third World nation, sudden crop loss or natural disaster, 
			or an assassination (or what we now call a geopolitical event). While price
			shocks are most common in futures markets, all markets are continually adjusting to
			new price levels, and all experience occasional surprises. Each news article, government
			economic release, or earnings report can be considered a mini-shock. A common price
			shock occurs when a pharmaceutical company’s application for a new drug is unexpectedly rejected 
			by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
		</p>
		<p>
			The pattern that results from episodic movement is exactly what one might expect.
			Following the sharp price movement, there is a period when volatility declines from its
			highs, narrowing until a normal volatility level is found and remaining at that level. In
			the Raytheon reaction to 9/11, the upwards price shock, shown in Figure 3.33 is followed
			by a volatile, unstable few days and then a steady decline in volatility as some level of
			equilibrium is found. The Raytheon price reacted opposite to most other stocks because
			it is a defense contractor, and a terrorist attack implies an increased amount of business
			from the government.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unless the news that caused the price shock was an error, in which case prices immediately 
			move back to levels prior to the news, prices will settle in a new trading range
			near the extreme highs or lows. It will take time for the market to absorb the consequences 
			of the news, and many traders will fi nd the risk too high to participate.
		</p>
		<p>
			Price shocks have become the focus of much analytic work. Because a price shock
			is an unpredictable event, it cannot be forecast. This has a critical effect on the way in
			which systems are developed, especially with regard to the testing procedures. We understand 
			at the time of the price shock that the event was entirely unexpected. However,
			years later, when the same prices are analyzed using a computer program, you might find
			that a trend or charting pattern predicted this move. The analysis records the profits as
			though they were predictable and you are now basing your conclusions on a false premise. 
			These important issues are covered in other parts of this book under the topics “Price
			Shocks,” “Searching for Robustness,” and “Optimization,” found in Chapters 21 and 22.
