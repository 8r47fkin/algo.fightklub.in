		<h2>Finding Consistent Patterns</h2>
		<p>
			A price chart is often considered a representation of human behavior. The goal of any
			chart analyst is to fi nd consistent, reliable, and logical patterns that can be used to
			predict price movement. In the classic approaches to charting, there are consolidations, 
			trend channels, top-and-bottom formations, and a multitude of other patterns
			that are created by the repeated action of large groups of people in similar circumstances 
			or with similar objectives. The most important of all the chart patterns is the
			trendline.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only recently have computer programs been able to interpret chart patterns; and
			only one book, Bulkowski’s Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns2 has managed to show a
			comprehensive analysis of chart formations. In all fairness, there can be numerous valid
			interpretations of the same chart. In order to identify a chart price formation, it is first
			necessary to select the data frequency (for example, daily or weekly), then the starting
			date and a time horizon (long-term or short-term), before a chart interpretation can begin. 
			Given the wide range of choices, it should be surprising that any two analysts see the
			same patterns at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Chart analyses, frequently published in magazines, may themselves be the cause of
			the repeated patterns. Novice speculators approach the problem with great enthusiasm
			and often some rigidity in an effort to follow to the rules. They will sell double and triple
			tops, buy breakouts, and generally do everything to propagate the survival of standard
			chart formations. Because of their following, it is wise to know the most popular techniques, 
			if only as a defensive measure. Chapter 4 will review some of the attempts to turn
			these patterns into trading systems.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What Causes Chart Patterns?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Speculators have many habits, which, taken in large numbers, cause recognizable chart
			patterns. The typical screen trader (not on the exchange fl oor), or an investor placing
			his or her own orders, will usually choose an even number—for example, buy Microsoft
			at $26.00, rather than at $26.15. If even dollar values are not used, then 50¢ and 25¢ are
			the next most likely increments, in that order. And, as the share prices get higher, the
			increments get farther apart. With Berkshire Hathaway (BKA) trading at $125,000 per
			share, placing an order at a $10 increment would seem very precise. In futures trading,
			the same is true. There are far more orders placed in the S&P Index at 1310.00 than at
			1306.50, or 10-year Treasury notes at 11516
			32 instead of 11519
			32 .
		</p>
		<p>
			The public is also said to always enter into the bull markets at the wrong time. When
			the television fi nancial news, syndicated newspapers, and radio carry stories of dangerously 
			low oil supplies, a new cancer treatment drug, or the devastation of the nation’s
			wheat crop, the infrequent speculator enters in what W. D. Gann calls the grand rush,
			causing the fi nal runaway move before the collapse or the fi nal sell-off before the rally;
			this behavior is easily identifi able on a chart. Gann also talks of lost motion, the effect of
			momentum that carries prices slightly past its goal. Professional traders recognize that
			a fast, volatile price may move as much as 10% farther than its objective. A downward
			swing in the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen from par at 1.0000 to a support level of 0.8000 could
			overshoot the bottom by 0.0100 without being considered significant.
		</p>
		<p>
			The behavioral aspects of prices appear rational. In the great bull markets, the 
			repeated price patterns and divergence from chance movement are indications of the 
			effects of mass psychology. The classic source of information on this topic is Mackay’s
			Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds originally published in
			1841.3 In the preface to the 1852 edition the author says:
		</p>
		<code>
			We fi nd that whole communities suddenly fi x their minds on one object, and go
			mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with
			one delusion. . . .
		</code>

			In 1975, sugar was being rationed in supermarkets at the highest price ever known,
			50¢ per pound. The public was so concerned that there would not be enough at any
			price that they bought and horded as much as possible. This extreme case of public 
			demand coincided with the price peak, and shortly afterwards the public found itself with
			an abundant supply of high-priced sugar in a rapidly declining market. The world stock
			markets are often the target of acts of mass psychology. While U.S. traders watched at a
			distance the collapse of the Japanese stock market from its heights of 38,957 at the end
			of December 1989 to its lows of 7,750 in 2003, a drop of 80%, they were able to experience 
			their own South Sea Bubble when the NASDAQ 100 fell 83.5% from its highs of 4,816
			in March 2000 to 795 in October 2002. And, while the subprime crisis has taken years
			to play out, the unparalleled drop in value of nearly all investments at the same time, 
			September 2008, was clearly an act of investor panic. Prices seem to drop suddenly at the
			time when buyers are most confi dent, then start the long climb up again. It should not be
			difficult to understand why contrary thinking has developed a strong following.
		</p>
		<p>
			Charting is a broad topic to be studied in detail; the chart paper itself and its scaling are 
			sources of controversy. A standard bar chart (or line chart) representing highs
			and lows can be plotted for daily, weekly, or monthly intervals in order to smooth out
			the price movement over time. Bar charts have been drawn on semilog and exponential
			scales,4 where the signifi cance of greater volatility at higher price levels is put into 
			proportion with the quieter movement in the low ranges by using percentage changes. Each
			variation gives the chartist a unique representation of price action. The shape of the
			chart box and its ratio of height/width will alter interpretations that are based on angles.
			Standard charting techniques may draw trendlines at 45° or 30° angles across the chart;
			therefore, expanding or compressing a chart on a screen will change the angles. This
			chapter uses traditional daily price charts and square boxes.
		</p>
		<p>
			It may be a concern to today’s chartist that the principles and rules that govern chart
			interpretation were based on the early stock market, using averages instead of individual 
			stocks or futures contracts. This is discussed in the next section. For now, refer to
			Edwards and Magee, who removed this problem by stating that “anything whose market
			value is determined solely by the free interplay of supply and demand” will form the same
			graphic representation. They continued to say that the aims and psychology of speculators 
			in either a stock or commodity environment would be essentially the same, that the
			effect of postwar government regulations have caused a “more orderly” market in which
			these same charting techniques can be used.
